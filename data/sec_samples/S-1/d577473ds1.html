<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are creating a new category of transformative medicines based on messenger RNA, or mRNA, to improve the lives of patients. From the beginning, we designed
our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mRNA over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases. We built and continue to invest in a platform to advance the technological frontier of mRNA
medicines. We made and continue to make forward investments in scalable infrastructure and capabilities to pursue a pipeline of potential medicines that reflect the breadth of the mRNA opportunity. Since we nominated our first program in late 2014,
we and our strategic collaborators have advanced in parallel a diverse development pipeline of 21 programs, of which 10 have entered clinical studies and another 3 have open INDs. Our therapeutic and vaccine development programs span infectious
diseases, oncology, cardiovascular diseases, and rare genetic diseases. We have assembled an exceptional team of approximately 680 employees and have established strategic alliances with leading biopharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca,
Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, as well as government-sponsored and private organizations focused on global health initiatives, including Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, or DARPA, and the Bill&nbsp;&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. As of September&nbsp;30, 2018, we have raised over $2.6&nbsp;billion in total funding from our strategic collaborators and investors, and have cash, cash equivalents, and
investments of $1.2&nbsp;billion. As we unlock the inherent advantages of mRNA, we aim to address as many diseases and impact as many patients as our technology, talent, and capital permit. </P>

instructions stored in DNA to make the proteins required in every living cell. Our approach is to use mRNA medicines to instruct a patient&#146;s own cells to produce proteins that could prevent, treat, or cure disease. A schematic of the central
role of mRNA in making proteins is shown in the figure below. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt" ALIGN="center">

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe mRNA&#146;s intrinsic properties could serve as a foundation for a new category of medicines for
patients. Every cell in the human body utilizes mRNA in existing natural processes to produce all types of proteins, including secreted, membrane, and intracellular proteins, in varying quantities, in different locations, and in various
combinations. mRNA has a pharmacological profile that we believe is consistent with the target profile of traditional therapeutics and has a simple molecular structure that comprises a sequence of four chemically similar nucleotides. To change a
protein encoded by an mRNA molecule, only a change to the sequence within the mRNA is required. As a result, each mRNA molecule is highly chemically similar, yet mRNAs can encode proteins with divergent chemical properties and functions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">mRNA medicines, we believe, represent an opportunity that could meaningfully exceed that of other classes of biopharmaceuticals. One such class, recombinant
protein therapeutics, which focuses on secreted proteins, today generates over $200 billion in annual worldwide sales. Two other types of proteins, intracellular and membrane proteins, represent as much as two-thirds of all human proteins and are
critical to human biology; however, delivery of these proteins is currently beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology. We believe that mRNA medicines could address all three protein types, including these areas untapped by recombinant
protein therapeutics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The breadth of biology addressable using mRNA technology is reflected in our current development pipeline of 21 programs. These
span 24 different proteins: ten different antigens (including complexes and virus-like particles, or VLPs) for infectious disease vaccines; two different types of neoantigen cancer vaccines, of which one is combined with an endoplasmic reticulum
membrane protein; four different immuno-modulator targets (including membrane and systemically secreted proteins) for immuno-oncology programs; one secreted, local regenerative factor for a heart failure program; three secreted proteins of diverse
biology (an antibody, an engineered protein hormone, and a lysosomal enzyme); and three intracellular enzymes for rare disease programs. The diversity of proteins made from mRNA within our development pipeline is shown in the figure below. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To guide our business, we established a set of strategic principles: discover and develop a large pipeline in parallel; undertake sustained and long-term
investment in technology creation; accelerate learning; integrate across critical parts of the value chain; and forward invest in capabilities and infrastructure. We apply these principles to critical capital allocation decisions such as: how much
capital we devote to technology, drug discovery, development, and infrastructure; which development candidates to advance and how; whether to advance development candidates alone or in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners or other sources of
funding; and which capabilities to build internally versus outsource. In addition, we see four key risks inherent to our business&#151;technology risk, biology risk, execution risk, and financing risk. We seek to actively manage these risks as we
apply our strategic principles in our decision making. There is no single strategic principle nor single category of risk that dominates our decision making. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We aim to compartmentalize risk in part by using modalities, each of which is a group of programs that share a combination of technologies to create a common
set of product features. Each modality is designed to overcome the challenges of delivering the right amount of mRNA to the right tissue at the right times across a portfolio of applications. We currently have six modalities: prophylactic vaccines;
cancer vaccines; intratumoral immuno-oncology; localized regenerative therapeutics; systemic secreted therapeutics; and systemic intracellular therapeutics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our platform </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have created a platform to improve the
underlying pharmaceutical properties of our mRNA medicines. Our platform consists of three core areas: mRNA technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing processes. We pursue mRNA science to minimize the undesirable activation of the immune
system by mRNA and to maximize the potency of mRNA once in the target cells. We pursue delivery science to protect mRNA from extracellular enzymes that would degrade it, to deliver mRNA to desired tissues, and to facilitate the transport of mRNA
across cell membranes to the translational machinery inside the cell. Finally, we pursue manufacturing process science to optimize these features for our potential mRNA medicines and to develop the technical capability to scale our mRNA for clinical
development. We believe that our science provides the foundation for technology advancement, with the ultimate goal of identifying new modalities and expanding the utility of our existing modalities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through September&nbsp;30, 2018, we have incurred approximately $480 million of expenses to advance our platform technology and our intellectual property.
This investment has underpinned the creation of our six existing modalities and 21&nbsp;programs, and has helped us to establish fundamental intellectual property protecting our platform and programs. We have filed over 1,500 patent applications
since 2010 (including pending and expired applications), and have over 100 issued or allowed U.S. and foreign patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Executing at scale on a broad
pipeline </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Executing rapidly on many pipeline programs in parallel requires investment in scalable capabilities across the entire drug development value
chain. mRNA has common chemical features, design rules, and synthetic processes that permit us to invest in scalable infrastructure, built on a digital backbone and enabled by automation, that is designed to generate and advance a broad pipeline. We
stage our scale efforts into three infrastructure groupings, or engines, to: (1)&nbsp;advance new product ideas to development candidates, (2)&nbsp;move development candidates into early clinical trials for human proof of concept, and
(3)&nbsp;advance these candidates through late-stage development, approval, and eventual commercialization. These engines are supported and enabled by our integrated digital investments, our highly talented and motivated team members, and our deep
capital base, which in total allow us to execute effectively. Manufacturing is a strategically critical component of </P>

launch Moderna, identified chemical modifications of mRNA, engineered mRNA sequences for greater <I>in vivo</I> potency, and demonstrated our first instances of <I>in vivo</I> protein expression. St&#233;phane Bancel joined Moderna&#146;s Board of
Directors in March 2011. Upon resigning as CEO of bioM&eacute;rieux (BIM:FP), Mr. Bancel became Executive Chairman of Moderna and a Senior Partner at Flagship Pioneering in July 2011. He was then named Moderna&#146;s founding CEO in October 2011.

information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; before investing in our common stock. Any
of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks or uncertainties actually occur, causing you to
lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements.
See the section titled &#147;Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#148; appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks related to our

funding through financings or from other sources. Clinical data or trial execution that creates delays, setbacks, or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities or the entire pipeline could result in an impaired ability or inability to
finance or fund the Company in the future. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently advancing our pipeline of 21 programs in development, 10 of which are in clinical
studies. Discovering development candidates and developing investigational medicines is expensive, and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to (i)&nbsp;perform basic research, perform preclinical studies, and conduct clinical trials of
our current and future programs, (ii)&nbsp;continue to develop and expand our platform and infrastructure and supply preclinical studies and clinical trials with appropriate grade materials (including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP,
materials), (iii) seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines, and (iv)&nbsp;launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial sales, marketing, and distribution
organization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&nbsp;30, 2018, we had approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. We estimate that the net
proceeds from this offering will be approximately $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million, assuming an initial public offering price of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per share, the midpoint of the price range set
forth on the cover of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments
will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned,
through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, sales of assets, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. In any
event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our investigational medicines. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital
if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. Our spending will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with discovery of
development candidates and development of our investigational medicines are highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development, marketing, and commercialization activities. Our future funding requirements,

sales of assets, licensing arrangements, and other marketing or distribution arrangements. Any fundraising efforts may divert our management from their <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT>
activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our investigational medicines. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts, at the right time, on favorable terms, or
at all. Negative clinical trial data or setbacks, or perceived setbacks, in our programs or with respect to our technology could impair our ability to raise additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may
adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. If we raise

ownership interest will be diluted. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as
incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements, sales of assets or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements
with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our development candidates and investigational medicines, technologies, future revenue streams, or research programs. We also could be required to seek strategic collaborators
for one or more of our current or future investigational medicines at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our rights to development candidates, investigational medicines, or intellectual property that we otherwise would
seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, at the right time, on favorable terms, or at all, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development or
commercialization of one or more of our products or investigational medicines, or one or more of our other research and development initiatives. Any of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and
results of operations, cause the price of our common stock to decline, and negatively impact our ability to fund operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are creating a new category of medicines based on mRNA, to improve the lives of patients. From the beginning, we designed our strategy and operations to
realize the full potential value and impact of mRNA over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases. We have made investments in our platform, infrastructure, and clinical capabilities that have enabled us to establish a pipeline of
21 programs in development, 10 of which are in clinical studies. As our development candidates and investigational medicines progress, we or others may determine: that certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient; that we
made platform level technology mistakes; that individual programs or our mRNA science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or underappreciated; that our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will
result in an inability to manufacture our products for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing; or that we have allocated resources in such a way that large investments are not recovered and capital allocation is not subject to rapid <FONT

take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline, including those related to mRNA technology, delivery technology, and manufacturing processes which may be shown to be incorrect based on further work by us, our strategic
collaborators, or others. To date, there has never been a Phase 3 trial or a commercialized product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient. Our mRNA medicines that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance,
experience delays in the clinic, experience clinical holds, or fail to reach the market for many reasons, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain. The number and design of the clinical and preclinical
studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established, may be different from those required for gene therapy products or may require safety testing like gene therapy products. Moreover, the length of time necessary
to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next, and may be difficult to predict. </P>

any phase of development including at phases where earlier programs in that modality were successful. This may be a result of technical challenges unique to that program or due to biology risk
which is unique to every program. As we progress our programs through clinical development, there may be new technical challenges that arise that cause an entire modality to fail. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we aim to segregate risk using modalities, there may be foreseen and unforeseen risks across modalities in whole or in part. These include, but are not
limited to, mRNA, chemical modifications, and LNPs and their components. In addition, if any one or more of our clinical programs encounter safety, tolerability, or efficacy problems, developmental delays, regulatory issues, or other problems, our
platform approach and business could be significantly harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the biology risk across the majority of our pipeline represents targets and
pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs. Only our H10N8 vaccine (mRNA-1440), H7N9 vaccine (mRNA-1851), phenylketonuria, or PKU, (mRNA-3283), and Fabry disease (mRNA-3630) programs pursue pathways where an approved
pharmaceutical product has validated the vaccine and therapeutic intervention points. While we believe we have made progress in seeking to reduce biology risk in certain settings, such as for vaccine targets for which we and others have shown the
utility of neutralizing antibodies, the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across the majority of our current and future programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>While we attempt to diversify our risks by developing one or more programs in each modality, there are&nbsp;risks&nbsp;that are unique to each modality
and risks that are applicable across modalities. These risks may impair our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval or ultimately commercialize our programs, or cause us to experience
significant delays in doing so, any of which may materially harm our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain features in our development candidates and investigational
medicines, including those related to mRNA, chemical modifications, surface chemistries, LNPs, and their components, may result in foreseen and unforeseen risks that are active across some or all of our modalities. Any such portfolio spanning risks,
whether known or unknown, if realized in any one of our programs would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our business as a whole. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and our programs as a whole.<B> </B>For example,<B> </B>prophylactic vaccines typically
require clinical testing in thousands to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefit-risk profile. The need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even
spurious safety findings, negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch. While we believe that certain safety, tolerability, and levels of immunogenicity we have observed in the early-stage clinical trials in our prophylactic
vaccine programs is sufficient to initiate additional trials, there can be no assurance that we will observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in later-stage trials required for approval of these programs.<B> </B>For neoantigen cancer vaccines,
to date, no molecular <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(non-cell-based)</FONT> therapeutic protein vaccine has been shown to be effective against cancer and there are many clinical and manufacturing challenges to personalized medicines, including
cell-based therapies and vaccines. These risks include: a rapid production turn-around time that is measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors, the significant costs
incurred in making individualized vaccines, and potential lack of immune responses potentially due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient. These and other risks apply to our personalized cancer vaccine, or PCV, and other

In general, several biological steps are required for delivery of mRNA to translate into therapeutically active medicines. These processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues, and this could lead to variable levels of therapeutic
protein, its activity, immunogenicity, or targeted or broad distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect.<B> </B>Gene therapies and mRNA based medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product
(e.g., the mRNA or the delivery vehicle, such as a lipid nanoparticle) as well as against the encoded protein, giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events. Eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our
ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a side-effect. These risks apply to all of our programs, including our systemic secreted therapeutics and systemic intracellular therapeutics modalities. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of our pipeline is in preclinical development, and these programs could be delayed or not advance into the clinic. Before we can initiate clinical trials
for a development candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical studies, including IND-enabling GLP toxicology testing, that support our planned Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, in the United States, or similar applications in
other jurisdictions. We must also complete extensive work on Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, or CMC, activities (including yield, purity and stability data) to be included in the IND filing. CMC activities for a new category of medicines
such as mRNA require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development, which is uncertain and lengthy. For instance, batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur. In addition, we have in the
past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our preclinical or clinical development candidates. If we are required to produce new batches of our
development candidates due to insufficient shelf life, it may delay the commencement or completion of preclinical or clinical trials of such development candidates. For example, we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our
preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the FDA or other regulatory authorities will accept the results of our preclinical testing or our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical testing, studies, and CMC
activities will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot
be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin. </P>

countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Some of our investigational medicines are classified as gene therapies by the
FDA and the EMA, and the FDA has indicated that our investigational medicines will be reviewed within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. Even though our mRNA investigational medicines are designed to have a different
mechanism of action from gene therapies, the association of our investigational medicines with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens, impair the reputation of our investigational medicines, or negatively impact our platform or
our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been few approvals of gene therapy products in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, and there have been
well-reported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use. Gene therapy products have the effect of introducing new DNA and potentially irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell. In contrast, mRNA is highly unlikely to localize to
the nucleus, integrate into the DNA, or otherwise make any permanent changes to cell DNA. Consequently, we expect that our investigational medicines will have a different potential side effect profile from gene therapies because they lack risks
associated with altering cell DNA irreversibly. Further, we may avail ourselves of ways of mitigating side effects in developing our investigational medicines to address safety concerns that are not available to all gene therapies, such as lowering
the dose of our investigational medicines during repeat dosing or stopping treatment to potentially ameliorate undesirable side effects. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in
the future, and the implications for mRNA-based therapies is unknown. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within CBER to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and convenes the
Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. In the EU, mRNA has been characterized as a Gene Therapy Medicinal Product. In certain countries, mRNA therapies have not yet been classified or any such
classification is not known to us, specifically, in Japan, the PMDA has not taken a position on the regulatory classification. Notwithstanding the differences between our mRNA investigational medicines and gene therapies, the classification of some
of our mRNA investigational medicines as gene therapies in the United States, the EU and potentially other counties could adversely impact our ability to develop our investigational medicines, and could negatively impact our platform and our
business. For instance, a clinical hold on gene therapy products across the field due to risks associated with altering cell DNA irreversibly may apply to our mRNA investigational medicines irrespective of the mechanistic differences between gene
therapies and mRNA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Adverse events reported with respect to gene therapies or genome editing therapies could adversely impact one or more of our
programs. Although our mRNA development candidates and investigational medicines are designed not to make any permanent changes to cell DNA, regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies products caused by
introducing new DNA and irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell could also be a risk for our mRNA investigational therapies, and as a result may delay one or more of our trials or impose additional testing for long-term side effects. Any new
requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory review agencies may have a negative effect on our business by lengthening the regulatory review process, requiring us to perform additional or larger studies, or increasing our development costs,
any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations, or
restrictions. As we advance our investigational medicines, we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay
or discontinue development of some or all of our investigational medicines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>A breakthrough therapy designation or fast track designation by the FDA

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for one or more of our investigational medicines. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended,
alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or
more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the
trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for priority review
if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the BLA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Designation as a breakthrough therapy is at the discretion of the FDA.
Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our investigational medicines meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a
breakthrough therapy designation for a drug may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In
addition, even if one or more of our investigational medicines qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the investigational medicine no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for
FDA review or approval will not be shortened. </P>

opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by a third party. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which
will reduce the number of trial participants who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Moreover, because in some cases our investigational medicines represent a departure from more traditional methods for disease
treatment and prevention, potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies or other new therapies rather than enroll trial participants in any future clinical trial involving mRNA investigational
medicines. Additionally, if new investigational medicines, such as gene editing therapies, show encouraging results, potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to enroll trial participants in clinical trials using those

available for our investigational medicines. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer
than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the
United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">user-fee</FONT> waivers. In addition, if a
product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other
applications, including a full new drug application, or NDA, or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan

United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective. Further, even if we obtain orphan
drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may receive and be approved for the same condition, and only the first applicant to
receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity. Even after an orphan-designated product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the

Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for
biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until
four years following the date that the reference product was first approved by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first
approved. During this <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a BLA for the competing product containing the
sponsor&#146;s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the other company&#146;s product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by

that the FDA will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact
the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic
substitution for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-biological</FONT> products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. </P>

commercialization of any development candidates and investigational medicines we may develop. Any mRNA medicine we may develop and the activities associated with its development and
commercialization, including design, testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable global health authorities. To
obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our investigational medicines, we and our strategic collaborators must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe, pure, and
potent or effective in humans, including the target population. Successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a BLA to the FDA, a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the EMA, and similar marketing applications
to comparable global regulatory authorities, for each investigational medicine and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any investigational medicines. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Failure to obtain marketing approval for an investigational medicine will prevent us from commercializing the investigational medicine in a given
jurisdiction. We have not received approval to market any investigational medicines from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction, and it is possible that none of our investigational medicines or any investigational medicines we may seek to
develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. We have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and may need to rely on third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, or
regulatory consultants to assist us in this process. To our knowledge, there is no current precedent for an mRNA based medicine such as the types we are developing being approved for sale by the FDA or any other global regulatory agency. Although we
expect to submit BLAs for our mRNA based investigational medicines in the United States, other jurisdictions may consider our mRNA based investigational medicines to be new drugs, not biologics, and require different marketing applications. Securing
regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the investigational medicine&#146;s safety and
efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Any investigational medicines we develop
may not be effective, may be only moderately effective, or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are
required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity, and novelty of the investigational medicines involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the
development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable
authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies. In
addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval of an investigational medicine. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to
restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Additional delays or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-approval</FONT> may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority
recommends <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-approval</FONT> or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes
in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies, and the review process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory agencies also may approve an
mRNA medicine for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for
the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be
costly and time-consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated
with FDA approval. We do not have any investigational medicines approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply
with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market

These product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile in later stages of clinical trials despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical
industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are
never approved as products and there can be no assurance that any of our current or future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our investigational medicines. </P>

which may not have ever been tested in humans. While we have continued to optimize our LNPs, there can be no assurance that our LNPs will not have undesired effects. Our LNPs could contribute, in whole or in part, to one or more of the following:
immune reactions, infusion reactions, complement reactions, opsonation reactions, antibody reactions including IgA, IgM, IgE or IgG or some combination thereof, or reactions to the PEG from some lipids or PEG otherwise associated with the LNP.
Certain aspects of our investigational medicines may induce immune reactions from either the mRNA or the lipid as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mRNA or the LNP, any of which could lead to significant adverse
events in one or more of our clinical trials. Many of these types of side effects have been seen for legacy LNPs. There may be resulting uncertainty as to the underlying cause of any such adverse event, which would make it difficult to accurately
predict side effects in future clinical trials and would result in significant delays in our programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If significant adverse events or other side
effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting trial participants to any of our clinical trials, trial participants may withdraw from trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our
development efforts of one or more development candidates or investigational medicines altogether. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, or an IRB, may impose a clinical hold, suspend or terminate clinical trials of an
investigational medicine at any time for various reasons, including a belief that participants in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry
that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval,
unfavorable benefit risk ratio may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. </P>

development, regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market the products. In addition, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity, and significant marketing efforts will be
required before we can generate any revenue from product sales. To date, our investigational medicines including RSV vaccine (mRNA-1777), CMV vaccine (mRNA-1647), hMPV+PIV3 vaccine (mRNA-1653), H10N8 vaccine (mRNA-1440), H7N9 vaccine (mRNA-1851),

manufacturing processes for our development candidates and investigational medicines are novel and complex. There are no mRNA medicines commercialized to date or manufactured at such scale. Due to the novel nature of this technology and limited
experience at larger scale production, we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing, product release, shelf life, testing, storage and supply chain management, or shipping. These difficulties could be due to any number of reasons including, but
not limited to, complexities of producing batches at larger scale, equipment failure, choice and quality of raw materials and excipients, analytical testing technology, and product instability. In an effort to optimize product features, we have in
the past and may in the future make changes to our development candidates or investigational medicines in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions. This has in the past resulted in and may in the future result in our having to
resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply. Insufficient stability or shelf life of our development candidates and investigational medicines could
materially delay our or our strategic collaborators&#146; ability to continue the clinical trial for that development candidate or investigational medicine or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product, due to the

</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are scaling up our batch size to accommodate the clinical supply requirements of some of our programs. However, in many cases, we may have to utilize
multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the clinical supply requirement of a single clinical trial. Failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials.

turn impact specification and stability of the drug product. Changes in our manufacturing processes may lead to failure of lots and this could lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trial. Our mRNA investigational medicines may prove to have a
stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved mRNA medicine. This poses risk in supply requirements, wasted stock, and higher cost of goods. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology. Further, we have developed our own custom manufacturing
equipment for certain of our investigational medicines. If such equipment malfunctions or we encounter unexpected performance issues, we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the number of different programs, we may have cross contamination of products inside of our factories, CROs, suppliers, or in the clinic that affect
the integrity of our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we scale the manufacturing output for particular programs, we plan to continuously improve yield, purity, and the
pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates from IND-enabling studies through commercial launch, including shelf life stability, and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance. Because of continuous improvement in
manufacturing processes, we may switch processes for a particular program during development. However, after the change in process, more time is required for pharmaceutical property testing, such as 6 or 12 month stability testing. That may require
resupplying clinical material, or making additional cGMP batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are utilizing a number of raw materials and excipients that are either new to the pharmaceutical industry or are being employed in a novel manner. Some of
these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures, or supply shortages. Such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays
or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our investigational medicines. Further, now and in the future one or more of our programs may have a single source of supply for raw materials and excipients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have established a number of analytical assays, and may have to establish several more, to assess the quality of our mRNA investigational medicines. We may
identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall. For example, we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety, efficacy, or stability. This may
lead to an inability to release mRNA investigational medicines until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product and product
intermediates are extremely temperature sensitive, and we may learn that any or all of our products are less stable than desired. We may also find that transportation conditions negatively impact product quality. This may require changes to the
formulation or manufacturing process for one or more of our investigational medicines and result in delays or interruptions to clinical or commercial supply. In addition, the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of
vendors may also add additional risks of supply disruptions. </P>

drug substance and drug product. While the design of the facility is based on current standards for biotechnology facilities, it has not been reviewed or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-approved</FONT> by any regulatory agency, nor has the
facility been inspected by any regulatory agency such as the FDA. We have only recently begun producing drug substance and drug product at Norwood for our preclinical and clinical use. We could incur delays in implementing the full operational state
of the facility, causing delays to clinical supply or extended use of third-party service providers, resulting in unplanned expenses. In constructing the Norwood facility, we have incurred substantial expenditures, and expect to incur significant
additional expenditures in validating and operating the facility in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have designed Norwood to incorporate a significant level of automation
of equipment with integration of several digital systems to improve efficiency of operations. We have attempted to achieve a high level of digitization for a clinical manufacturing facility relative to industry standards. While this is meant to
improve operational efficiency, this may pose additional risk of process equipment malfunction and even overall manufacturing system failure or shutdown due to internal or external factors including, but not limited to, design issues, system
compatibility, or potential cybersecurity breaches. This may lead to delay in supply or shutdown of our facility. Any disruption in our manufacturing capabilities at Norwood could cause delays in our production capacity for our drug substances or
drug products, impose additional costs, or may require us to identify, qualify, and establish an alternative manufacturing site, the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of

for any of our mRNA medicines, there is no assurance that either we or our contract manufacturing organizations will be able to manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it
in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of
one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our investigational medicines, impair commercialization efforts or increase our cost of goods. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract
manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance, and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which
exposes our contract manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory
status of our contract manufacturers&#146; facility. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions,
civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of investigational medicines or products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely
affect supplies of our products and investigational medicines (including those of our strategic collaborators) and our overall business operations. Our potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our investigational medicines and
raw materials may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA, the EMA, and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product together with the
protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we do not distribute a lot or lots until the relevant agency authorizes such release.
Deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Our third-party contract manufacturers have,
in the past, experienced lot failures and some may have experienced product recalls. Lot failures have in the past caused, and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own facilities or those of
our third-party manufacturers could cause, us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product </P>

number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United&nbsp;States, the potential market for the subject investigational
medicine, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such investigational medicine to trial participants, the potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if
there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The strategic collaborator may also consider alternative investigational medicines or technologies for similar
indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our investigational medicine. The terms of any additional strategic alliances or other arrangements that we may
establish may not be favorable to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also restricted under our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into certain future
agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own. These restrictions on working with targets, polypeptides, routes of administration, and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic

not be able to negotiate additional strategic alliances on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. Strategic alliances are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. If we are unable to negotiate and enter into new strategic
alliances, we may have to curtail the development of the investigational medicine for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential
commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or
commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our investigational medicines

key processes, and finished goods exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases, or late deliveries. There are, in general, relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components. These vendors may be
unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components, materials, and processes could take a substantial amount of time and it may be

Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our investigational medicines, if required, may not be accomplished quickly. If we are able to find

protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the
general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulations, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to
assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed
clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal sanctions. For any violations of laws and regulations during the

studies and clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately informed, among other things, of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We also
are responsible for ensuring that the rights of our clinical trial participants are protected. These regulations are enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, and comparable foreign regulatory
authorities for any investigational medicines in clinical development. The FDA enforces GCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with
applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.
We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with GCPs. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with investigational medicines produced in accordance with the
requirements in cGMP regulations. Our failure or the failure of our CROs to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action.

which has resulted in many different patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain intellectual property protection in the field. We have obtained grants and issuances of patents on mRNA medicines and our
delivery technology. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that we own, claim many different methods, compositions, and processes relating to the discovery, development,
manufacture, and commercialization of mRNA medicines and our delivery technology, including LNPs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the field of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines is
maturing, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there will be
significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference, reexamination, and opposition proceedings, as well as <I>inter partes </I>and post-grant review proceedings introduced by provisions of the America Invents Act, which became
available to third-party challengers on September&nbsp;16, 2012, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mRNA field. We expect that oppositions will be filed in the European Patent Office, or EPO, and elsewhere relating to patents
and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The
timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims. For example, a third party filed a
request for an <I>ex parte</I> reexamination of one of our U.S. patents, which relates to our influenza vaccine program. We cannot be certain that such patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form. In addition, third
parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to
circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the
field of mRNA therapeutics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide delivery technologies that we may need for
our mRNA therapeutic and vaccine candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for mRNA medicines we wish to develop. For example, we are aware of a third-party patent directed to
methods of using mRNA to treat Fabry disease. In addition, there may be issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party&#146;s belief that we may need such

Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we may need a license, or hold patent rights which could be asserted against us. If those organizations refuse
to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have been asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms, we may be unable to perform research and
development or other activities or market products covered by such patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of
litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, <I>ex parte</I>
reexaminations, post-grant review, and <I>inter partes </I>review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications,
which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. In certain instances, we have instituted and may in the future institute <I>inter partes </I>review proceedings against issued U.S. patents and
opposition proceedings against European patents owned by third parties in the field of mRNA medicines. We have a number of these proceedings ongoing against third-party patents related to cancer vaccinations and mRNA delivery. As the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our development candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications
with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our investigational medicines. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending
patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our investigational medicines may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents. If any third-party
patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our investigational medicines, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may
obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such investigational medicine unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any
third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to
develop and commercialize the applicable investigational medicine unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. For example, if we are
unsuccessful in invalidating certain of the third-party patents that we are currently challenging, those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against us should certain of our investigational medicines obtain regulatory approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Defense of infringement and other claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of
employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our
infringing products, or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms, if at all, or may require substantial time and expense. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, such licenses are likely to be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive</FONT> and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same

provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our intellectual property may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior intellectual property positions in the relevant fields, which could
result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in connection with certain license and
strategic alliance agreements, we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights or the subject matter of the agreements. The cost to us of any
litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management&#146;s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of
complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research and development efforts and limit our
ability to continue our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary intellectual property rights to product
components and manufacturing processes for our development pipeline. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Presently we have rights to certain intellectual property, through licenses
from third parties and under patents that we own, to develop our development candidates or investigational medicines. Because our pipeline may involve additional development candidates that could require the use of proprietary rights held by third
parties, the growth of our business could depend in part on our ability to acquire, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-license,</FONT> or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our development candidates or investigational medicines may require
specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-license</FONT> any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party
intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or
acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization
capabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, we sometimes collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development
under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution&#146;s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such right of
first negotiation for intellectual property, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to
other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to
assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to
required third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and prospects for growth could suffer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are not able to

success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully
using our inventions and proprietary information. However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to develop, manufacture, and commercialize our proposed products. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until the patents issue, such as applications
filed prior to November&nbsp;29, 2000, or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being
aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing exclusivity. Further, we may be required to obtain
licenses under third-party patents to market our proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities. If licenses are not available to us on favorable terms, we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the
desired activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we may rely on
third-party strategic collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly as a part of certain strategic alliances. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our
present or future strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our
strategic collaborators to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. While issued patents are presumed valid, this does not guarantee that the patent will survive a
validity challenge or be held enforceable. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated, adjudged unenforceable, or circumvented by parties attempting to design around our intellectual property. Moreover,
third parties or the USPTO may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any challenge to, finding of unenforceability or invalidation, or circumvention of, our patents or patent applications, would be costly,
would require significant time and attention of our management, could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from third-party licensors and could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is
generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Similarly, the ultimate degree
of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions, including ours, in the United States and foreign countries, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices, courts, and lawmakers.
Moreover, there are periodic discussions in the Congress of the United States and in international jurisdictions about modifying various aspects of patent law. For example, the America Invents Act, which took effect in March 2013, included a number
of changes to the patent laws of the United States. If any of the enacted changes prevent us from adequately protecting our discoveries, including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents to obtain injunctive relieve or for substantial
damages, our business could be adversely affected. One major provision of the America Invents Act changed U.S. patent practice from a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">first-to-invent</FONT></FONT> to a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">first-to-file</FONT></FONT> system. If we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention, we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in
possession of the invention prior to the competitor&#146;s filing date, and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or
allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. In certain countries, for example, methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to
us or to others. We also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how,</FONT> and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. If any trade secret, know-how, or other
technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. </P>

including patent eligible subject matter, lack of novelty, obviousness, or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-enablement.</FONT> Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation
that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or
abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include reexamination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment
to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our development candidates or investigational medicines. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for
example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at
least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our development candidates and investigational medicines. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing
patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and therefore obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently
enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain
situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S.
Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the
future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents on development candidates and investigational medicines in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively
expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the
same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United&nbsp;States, or from selling or importing products made using
our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing
products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or
sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights
in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to
biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign
jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing
and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be </P>

anti-bribery regulations, which include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other countries outside of the United States. We are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program based on what
we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry for companies similar to ours, but we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, or our third-party contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state,
and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption. Moreover, our strategic collaborators and third-party contractors located outside the United States may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the
territories in which they operate. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of
newly-approved products, in a new category of medicines, is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to
generate revenue. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to
afford expensive treatments such as the medicines that we hope to develop and sell. In addition, because our personalized cancer vaccine and intratumoral immuno-oncology investigational medicines represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer,
we cannot accurately estimate how these products would be priced, whether reimbursement could be obtained, or any potential revenue. Sales of our investigational medicines will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to
which the costs of our investigational medicines will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health
coverage insurers, and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines. Even if coverage is provided, the approved
reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment in any of our products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products, including genetic medicines. In the United
States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as CMS decides
whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such
as ours. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries.

in the European Union, with limited participation from the marketing authorization holders. We cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic
collaborators. If the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement levels that are not commercially attractive for us or our strategic collaborators, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic collaborators,
and the potential profitability of our drug products, in those countries would be negatively affected. An increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing cost-cutting efforts on
pharmaceuticals for their <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">state-run</FONT> health care systems. These international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world, but have been most drastic in the European Union. Additionally, some
countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a
product in a particular country, but then may experience delays in the reimbursement approval of our product or be subject to price regulations that would delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could
negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, increasing efforts by
governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or
provide adequate payment for our investigational medicines. For example, the U.S. government recently released a &#147;Blueprint&#148;, or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. This Blueprint contains certain measures that the HHS is already working to
implement. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts,
restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our investigational medicines, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the
increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense.
As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Healthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or
enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA
was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed
by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and
promoted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the implementation and impact of the ACA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some
of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective
January&nbsp;1, 2019, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-based</FONT> shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred
to as the &#147;individual mandate.&#148; CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the
essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on October&nbsp;13, 2017, an Executive Order was signed terminating the cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, subsidies

that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys
General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October&nbsp;25, 2017. Another Executive Order was signed directing federal
agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory
burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. With the current presidential administration and Congress, there may be additional administrative or legislative changes, including
modification, repeal, or replacement of all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. However, it remains to be seen whether new legislation modifying the ACA will be enacted and, if so, precisely what the new legislation will provide, when it will be
enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The implications of a potential repeal or replacement of the ACA, for our and our strategic collaborators&#146; business and
financial condition, if any, are not yet clear. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA
was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for
the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal
year. These reductions will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The delivery of healthcare in the EU,
including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have
different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the
pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our
investigational medicines, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that additional foreign, state and federal healthcare reform measures or proposals will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the
amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our investigational medicines or additional pricing pressures. In the event that the pricing structures for healthcare
products, such as the investigational medicines we are developing, change materially and limit payments for such investigational medicines, our business will be adversely impacted as our products may no longer be commercially viable based on their
expected net present value; we may have invested significant resources in products that cannot be commercially developed; or we may determine that assets that have reached an early phase of development cannot or will not be taken into further
development, notwithstanding their clinical viability. In addition, development assets or clinical programs that are part of our strategic alliances may no longer be deemed commercially viable to pursue based on our strategic collaborators&#146;
assessments of the impact of any proposed, announced, or legislated pricing reforms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted
in the future. Further federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from
investigational medicines that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval, and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop investigational medicines. </P>

support commercial infrastructure. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our investigational medicines will be adversely affected. The manner and level at which reimbursement is
provided for services related to our investigational medicines (e.g., for administration of our product to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to

treatments for severe rare genetic diseases. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our programs, are based on
estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of trial participants in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than

approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy but there is no guarantee that our investigational medicines, even if approved, would be approved for earlier lines of therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we may

from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers. The
number of trial participants may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our investigational medicines may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our investigational
medicines. Even if we obtain significant market share for our products, if approved, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications. </P>

operations. To manage our anticipated development and expansion, including potential expansion outside of the United States, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational,
and financial systems, expand our facilities, and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

growing biotechnology company, we are actively pursuing development candidates and investigational medicines in many therapeutic areas and across a wide range of diseases. Successfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory
and manufacturing pathways to all of these therapeutic areas and disease states requires a significant depth of talent, resources, and corporate processes in order to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas. Due to our limited resources
and early stage of growth, we may not be able to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise
to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other
projects, such as the development of our investigational medicines. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our
revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our investigational medicines, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified

will,&#148; meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time. The loss of any of these persons&#146; services may adversely impact the achievement of our research, development, financing and
commercialization objectives. We currently do not have &#147;key person&#148; insurance on any of our employees. Many of our key employees, including members of our executive team, have been with us for a long period of time, and have fully vested
stock options or other long-term equity incentives which may become valuable and will be publicly tradable if we become a public company. We may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry,
particularly in Cambridge, MA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we rely on consultants, contractors and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in
formulating our research and development, regulatory approval, and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other
entities that may limit their availability to us. The loss of the services of one or more of our current employees or advisors might impede the achievement of our research, development, regulatory approval and commercialization objectives. In
addition, we have flexibly grown our workforce through the use of contractors and part time workers. We may not be able to retain the services of such personnel which might result in delays in the operation of our business. </P>

this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such

disputes, sexual harassment, or other employment issues. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow
individuals access to a broad audience, these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Certain companies that have faced employment- or harassment-related lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel, and
have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business. If we were to face any employment-related claims, our business could be negatively affected. </P>

substantial hazard to the public health. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of any investigational medicine in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may,
under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and
issues. Recalls of any of our investigational medicines would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers

The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for net business interest
expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income (with certain excepted businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses generated during or after 2018 to 80% of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, and
modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as
&#147;orphan drugs&#148;). We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. However, the effect of the TCJA on our business, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain and may not become evident for some period
of time. We urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of the TCJA on an investment in our common stock. </P>

begin to expire in 2028. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In general, under Sections 382 and
383 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an &#147;ownership change&#148; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-change</FONT> net operating losses or tax credits, or NOLs or credits, to
offset future taxable income or taxes. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation&#146;s stock increases
its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Our existing NOLs or credits may be subject to limitations if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after this
offering. Our ability to utilize NOLs or credits could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under
Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Our NOLs or credits may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs or credits. In addition, the rules regarding timing of revenue and expense
recognition for tax purposes in connection with various transactions we have are complex and uncertain in various respects and could be subject to challenge by taxing authorities. In the event any such challenge is sustained, the net operating
losses could be materially reduced and/or we could be determined to be a material cash taxpayer for one or more years. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs or credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S.
federal and state taxable income. As described above we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and therefore, we do not know whether or
when we will generate the U.S. federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our NOL or credit carryforwards. Under the TCJA, NOLs generated after December&nbsp;31, 2017 will not be subject to expiration. The TCJA also reduced the corporate
income tax rate to 21%, from a prior rate of 35%. This may cause a reduction in the potential economic benefit of our NOLs and other available deferred tax assets. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we will incur significant legal, accounting and other
expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the federal securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq have imposed various
requirements on public companies, including requirements to file annual, quarterly, and event driven reports with respect to our business and financial condition, and to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and
corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and
will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We may not be able to produce
reliable financial statements or file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the SEC or comply with the Nasdaq listing requirements. In addition, we could make errors in our financial statements that could
require us to restate our financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we will be required
to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we
remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within
the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially
engage outside consultants, and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are
functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be
able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the
reliability of our financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted.
There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Dodd-Frank</FONT> Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as &#147;say on
pay&#148; and proxy access. Recent legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of this offering. We intend to take advantage of
this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current
high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot
currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. </P>

negotiations with the underwriters. Although we have applied to have our common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. If an active market

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to our amended and restated by-laws, as will be in effect upon the completion of this offering, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (1)&nbsp;any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim of or based on
a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees, or
stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated by-laws, or (4)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated by-laws will
further provide that the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. In addition, our amended and restated
by-laws will provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions; provided, however, that stockholders will not be
deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We have chosen the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such causes of action
because our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, MA. Some companies that have adopted similar federal district court forum selection provisions are currently subject to a suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
brought by stockholders who assert that the federal district court forum selection provision is not enforceable. We recognize that the federal district court forum selection clause may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert
the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Additionally, the forum selection
clauses in our amended and restated by-laws may limit our stockholders&#146; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Alternatively, if the federal district court forum selection provision is found inapplicable to, or
unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located
or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders. </P>

Series&nbsp;A and Series&nbsp;B preferred stock have received cash distributions that will materially impact the applicable conversion ratio, while the holders of Series&nbsp;C, Series&nbsp;D and Series E preferred stock have received cash
distributions that will not materially impact the applicable conversion ratio. The Series&nbsp;H preferred stock is not convertible at the option of the holder until after February&nbsp;7, 2020, after which, it will be convertible into common stock
on a one-for-2.485 basis because the applicable original issuance price for such series is $25.00 and the initial applicable conversion price is $10.06. In the event of an automatic conversion, the Series&nbsp;H preferred stock will convert at
(a)&nbsp;in the case of an initial public offering, a conversion ratio equal to dividing the original issuance price of $25.00 by the greater of (i)&nbsp;the product of 0.9 multiplied by the initial public offering price per share of common stock
set forth on the final prospectus of such offering and (ii)&nbsp;$10.06 or (b)&nbsp;in the case of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, a conversion ratio equal to dividing the original issuance price by the greater of (i)&nbsp;the product of

transformative medicines based on mRNA to improve the lives of patients. From the beginning, we designed our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mRNA over a long time horizon across a broad array of human
diseases. We built and continue to invest in a platform to advance the technological frontier of mRNA medicines. We have made forward investments in scalable infrastructure and capabilities to pursue a pipeline of potential medicines that reflect
the breadth of the mRNA opportunity. Since we nominated our first program in late 2014, we and our strategic collaborators have advanced in parallel a diverse development pipeline of 21 programs, 10 of which have entered clinical studies. Our
therapeutic and vaccine development programs span infectious diseases, oncology, cardiovascular diseases, and rare genetic diseases. We have assembled an exceptional team of approximately 680 employees and have established strategic alliances with
leading biopharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., or Merck, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, or Vertex, as well as government-sponsored and private organizations focused on global health initiatives, including Biomedical
Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and the Bill&nbsp;&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. As of September&nbsp;30, 2018, we have raised over $2.6&nbsp;billion in total funding from
our strategic collaborators and investors, and have cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.2&nbsp;billion. As we unlock the inherent advantages of mRNA, we aim to address as many diseases and impact as many patients as our technology, talent,
and capital permit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The broad potential applications of mRNA medicines have led us to raise significant capital and adopt a long-term approach to capital
allocation that balances near-term risks and long-term value creation. From inception to September&nbsp;30, 2018 we have raised over $2.6&nbsp;billion in total funding from a wide range of strategic sources, including $0.8&nbsp;billion in upfront
payments, milestone payments and option exercise payments from AstraZeneca, Merck, Alexion Pharma Holdings, or Alexion, and Vertex, and $1.8&nbsp;billion of financing from equity investors. We use this capital to fund operations and investing
activities across research for technology creation, drug discovery and clinical development programs, infrastructure and capabilities to enable the Research Engine and Early Development Engine (which includes our manufacturing facility in Norwood),
our digital infrastructure, creation of our portfolio of intellectual property, and administrative support. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since inception, we have incurred significant
operating losses. Our net losses were $216.2&nbsp;million and $255.9&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and $218.0&nbsp;million and $243.3&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2017
and 2018, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and September 30, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $621.9&nbsp;million and $865.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the
foreseeable future. In addition, we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

combination of enabling mRNA technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing processes. The program-specific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs, which consist primarily of
external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, central laboratories, investigative sites, and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical studies, and allocated manufacturing costs of mRNA supply and consumables. Costs to acquire
and manufacture mRNA supply for preclinical and clinical studies are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred, and subsequently allocated to program-specific manufacturing costs after completion of the
program-specific production. The timing of allocating manufacturing costs to program-specific costs varies depending on the program development and production schedule. We do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation,
costs associated with our general platform research, technical development, and other shared costs on a program-specific basis. These costs were therefore excluded from the summary of program-specific expenses summary by modality. </P>

expenditures. Continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business. Investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical
development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect these costs to continue to increase in the future as investigational medicines progress through the development phases and as we identify and
develop additional programs. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of
any of our investigational medicines, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory
factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>General and administrative expenses </I></B></P>

costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate general and
administrative expenses will increase as research and development expands. These increases will likely relate to additional personnel and increased costs related to finance, legal and IP-related matters along with increased expenses related to
operating as a publicly traded company, such as fees related to audit, legal, and tax services, regulatory compliance programs and investor relations. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our investigational medicines and do not
enter into a third-party commercialization collaboration, we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales and marketing team to support medicine sales, marketing, and distribution activities. </P>

revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates, if any, are reflected in the consolidated

various types of payments to us, including upfront fees, funding of research and development services and preclinical and clinical material, technical, development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, licensing fees, option exercise fees,

605-25. The evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about individual deliverables and whether such deliverables represent separate units of accounting, or whether they must be accounted for as a single
unit of accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i)&nbsp;the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis, and (ii)&nbsp;if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative
to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially controlled by us. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing, and
commercialization capabilities of the strategic collaborator, and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the strategic collaborator can use the other deliverable(s) for their
intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s), and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the
applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are applied to determine the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25.
Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not
available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price, since we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining
the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating
the agreement with the strategic collaborator and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of
arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting. </P>

arrangement without exercising the option, the likelihood of option exercise, and whether the strategic collaborator is required or compelled through significant incentive to exercise the option. If an option in an arrangement is considered
substantive, the rights obtained upon exercise of the option are excluded from the identification of deliverables for allocation of total arrangement consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount.

to the 2016 Reorganization, units); (ii)&nbsp;the expected term of the award; (iii)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate; (iv)&nbsp;expected dividends; and (v)&nbsp;the fair value of common stock (or, prior to the 2016 Reorganization, units). Due to the
lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we based our estimate of expected volatility on the estimate and expected volatilities of a guideline group of publicly traded companies. For these analyses, we select companies with
comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily
closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the
volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors using the simplified method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term
and the original contractual term of the option. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For stock options granted to non-employees, we
utilize the contractual term of the option as the basis for the expected term assumption. For the determination of the risk-free interest rates we utilize the U.S. Treasury yield curve for instruments in effect at the time of measurement with a term
commensurate with the expected term assumption. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. Historically, for periods prior to this initial
public offering, the fair value of our equity instruments underlying our stock-based awards were determined on each grant date by our board of directors based on valuation estimates from management considering our most recently available independent
third-party valuation of our equity instruments. Our board of directors also assessed and considered, with input from management, additional objective and subjective factors that we believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of
the most recent valuation through the grant date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table sets forth by grant date and type of award, the number of equity awards granted,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The independent third-party valuations were prepared in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#146;
Technical Practice Aid, <I>Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,</I> or the Practice Aid. The Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of
capital stock to determine the estimated fair value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM, and the Option-Pricing Method, or OPM, were the most
appropriate methods for determining the fair value of our common units or common stock, based on our stage of development and other relevant factors. Our valuations prior to May 2018 were based on a hybrid method of the PWERM and the OPM and
subsequent valuations were based on the PWERM. This change was necessary in order to reflect variations, depending on the circumstances, in the conversion ratio of our Series H preferred stock issued in May 2018. The PWERM is a scenario-based
analysis that estimates value per share based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to us, as well as the economic and control rights of each share class.
Under the OPM, each class of stock is modeled as a call option with a distinct claim on the enterprise value of the Company. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the enterprise value exceeds the total liquidation preference of the
preferred stock at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. The hybrid method is a hybrid between the PWERM and OPM estimating the probability-weighted value across multiple scenarios but using the OPM to estimate the
allocation of value within at least one of these scenarios. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, management considered

an IPO in September 2018, an IPO in September 2019, and a remain-private scenario. Each IPO scenario assumes the conversion of preferred shares to common shares. For the remain-private scenario, we allocated equity value using the OPM. We estimated
our per share value in an IPO as a step-up, or appreciation in value, from the Series&nbsp;F preferred issuance stock price. For the remain-private scenario, we estimated our equity value by using the OPM to backsolve to the Series&nbsp;F preferred
issuance stock price, after adjusting for the value of Series&nbsp;F preferred stock in IPO scenarios. We assigned a weight of 27.5% to the September 2018 IPO scenario, a weight of 27.5% to the September 2019 scenario, and a weight of 45.0% to the
remain-private scenario. We applied a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) to the values indicated for our common stock in each scenario. A discount is appropriate because our common stock is unregistered, and the holder of a minority interest

We estimated our per share value in an IPO using the discounted cash flow method and applied an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to a forecast of cash flows, which were probability-weighted to reflect success rates in clinical trials. For the
remain-private scenario, we estimated our equity value by using the OPM to backsolve to the Series G preferred stock issuance price, after adjusting for the value of the Series G preferred stock in the IPO scenario. In an OPM framework, the
backsolve method for inferring the equity value implied by a recent financing transaction involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility, and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that value for the
most recent financing equals the amount paid. This method was selected as management concluded that the contemporaneous financing transaction was an arm&#146;s length transaction. We assigned a weighting of 65% to the IPO scenario and a weighting of
35% to the remain-private scenario. We applied a DLOM to the values indicated for our common stock in each scenario. A discount is appropriate because our common stock is unregistered, and the holder of a minority interest in the common stock may

of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income, the amount and timing of which are uncertain. Valuation allowances are provided, if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets based on management&#146;s evaluation of all available evidence. </P>

by management and subject to change, which may be substantial. We develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions, and the associated cumulative probabilities, using internal expertise and assistance from third-party experts. As additional
information becomes available, estimates are revised and refined. Differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax expense. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We record reserves for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. These reserves are based on a determination of
whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties
associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. To date, no amount has been recorded for uncertain tax positions. </P>

tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of
current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain
important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. </P>

$64.1&nbsp;million reduction to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. This preliminary estimate of the effects of the TCJA is subject to the finalization of management&#146;s analysis related to certain

compared to $113.9&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in grant revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Collaboration revenue increased by $1.1&nbsp;million, or 1%,
to $89.7&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $88.6&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, mainly driven by increases in collaboration revenue from AstraZeneca and Vertex, partially offset by the
termination of the Alexion strategic alliance arrangement in October 2017. Grant revenue decreased by $15.4&nbsp;million, or 61%, to $10.0&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $25.4&nbsp;million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of $12.7 million from the BARDA contract, primarily due to revisions to the Zika program. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income, net increased by $7.4&nbsp;million, or 77%, to $17.1&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018
compared to $9.6&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $6.7&nbsp;million in interest income from our investments in marketable securities, driven by an overall higher market
interest rate and a higher weighted average balance of cash and investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and an increase of $2.5&nbsp;million in gain from the sale and
maturity of our investments in marketable securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. These increases were partially offset by higher interest expense of $1.5 million related to our
Norwood construction financing obligation. We began recording interest expense upon the completion of the Norwood building in July 2018. Please see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total revenue increased by $97.4&nbsp;million, or 90%, to $205.8&nbsp;million in 2017 compared to $108.4&nbsp;million in 2016,
due to increases in both collaboration revenue and grant revenue recognized in 2017. Collaboration revenue increased by $75.4&nbsp;million, or 74%, to $177.0&nbsp;million in 2017 compared to $101.6&nbsp;million in 2016, mainly driven by
$70.3&nbsp;million of revenue recognized as a result of the termination of the Alexion strategic alliance arrangements. Grant revenue increased by $22.0&nbsp;million, or 321%, to $28.9&nbsp;million in 2017 compared to $6.9&nbsp;million in 2016. The
increase was largely attributable to having a full year revenue recognized from the BARDA contract, which was entered in the second half of 2016 in support of the development of a mRNA vaccine for Zika. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income, net increased by $4.8&nbsp;million, or 55%, to $13.4&nbsp;million in 2017 compared to $8.6&nbsp;million in 2016.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.9&nbsp;million in interest income from our investment in marketable securities, driven by an overall higher market interest rate and a higher weighted average balance of cash and investments during
2017 compared to 2016, and a decrease of $1.3&nbsp;million in loss from the sale of our investments in marketable securities in 2017 compared to 2016. </P>

funded our operations primarily from the sale of preferred equity instruments and from proceeds from certain strategic alliance arrangements and grant agreements. From inception through September&nbsp;30, 2018, we have raised an aggregate of
$1.8&nbsp;billion of proceeds through the issuance of equity and $0.8&nbsp;billion from upfront payments, milestone payments, and option exercise fees related to our strategic alliances. As of September&nbsp;30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents,
restricted cash, and investments of $1.2&nbsp;billion. Cash and cash equivalents and investments are invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Investments, consisting primarily of
government and corporate debt securities are stated at fair value. As of September&nbsp;30, 2018, we had current and non-current investments of approximately $905.1&nbsp;million and $150.4&nbsp;million, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We began construction of Norwood in the second half of 2016. Our capital expenditures related to Norwood were $18.2&nbsp;million and $59.9&nbsp;million for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and $27.8&nbsp;million and $75.3&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Cash disbursements related to Norwood were $3.1&nbsp;million and
$41.2&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and $18.3&nbsp;million and $83.2&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Norwood officially opened in July 2018.

2018, we issued Series H preferred stock for gross proceeds of $125.0&nbsp;million of which $13.0 million is determined to be a premium, and recorded to deferred revenue as part of the Merck PCV/SAV agreement executed contemporaneously. Please see

needs through public or private equity or debt offerings and potential future strategic alliances from which we receive upfront fees, milestone payments, and other forms of consideration. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms,

medicines, or slow down or cease work on one or more of our programs. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders or increased fixed payment
obligations, and any such securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as
limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise
funds through strategic alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or investigational medicines or
grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. </P>

development, and manufacturing activities related to PCV products through an initial Phase 2 clinical trial up to a budgeted amount of $200.0 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. In April 2018, we amended the PCV agreement with Merck and the
budgeted commitment increased to $243.0 million. Please see Note&nbsp;15 to the consolidated financial statement appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. The expenses we expect to incur as part of our commitments under the PCV and other collaboration
agreements were not included in the above table as we are not able to determine the timing and amounts of such expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have agreements with certain
vendors for various services, including services related to clinical operations and support, for which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the vendors. Certain agreements provide for
termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs. Under such agreements, we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors, mainly, to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.
The exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination, and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated. At December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cancellable open purchase orders of
$44.4&nbsp;million in total under such agreements for our significant clinical operations and support. These amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay as December&nbsp;31, 2017, assuming we
would not cancel these agreements. The actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the cancellable open purchase order amounts of $44.4&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the above obligations, we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business. The terms generally
allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these
agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>JOBS Act and

standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for EGCs include presentation of only two years of audited financial statements in a registration
statement for an initial public offering, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor&#146;s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an exemption from any
requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. Additionally, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC
can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, while we are an emerging growth company we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other
public companies that are not emerging growth companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will remain classified as an EGC until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the last day of our first

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, we had cash, cash
equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable securities of $1.3&nbsp;billion, $914.6&nbsp;million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Our investment portfolio is comprised of money market funds and marketable debt securities (including
U.S. Treasury securities, debt securities of U.S. government agencies and corporate entities, and commercial paper). Our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity and our investment policy defines
allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to minimize risk exposure. Our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Our available for
sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We generally hold investments in marketable
debt securities to maturity to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. Due to the short-term maturities and low risk profiles of our investments, we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk. If market interest rates were to
increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points, or one percentage point, from levels at December&nbsp;31, 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, the net fair value of our interest sensitive marketable securities would not experience a material
change in fair market value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently do not have significant exposure to foreign currencies as we hold no foreign exchange contracts, option
contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Further, our operations and revenue generating activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our operations may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Messenger RNA, or mRNA, transfers the information stored in our genes to the cellular machinery that makes all the proteins required for life. Our
genes are stored as sequences of DNA which contain the instructions to make specific proteins. DNA serves as a hard drive, safely storing these instructions in the nucleus until they are needed by the cell. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When a cell needs to produce a protein, the instructions to make that protein are copied from the DNA to mRNA, which serves as the template for protein
production. Each mRNA molecule contains the instructions to produce a specific protein with a distinct function in the body. mRNA transmits those instructions to cellular machinery, called ribosomes, that make copies of the required protein. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We see mRNA functioning as the &#147;software of life.&#148; Every cell uses mRNA to provide real time instructions to make the proteins necessary to drive
all aspects of biology, including in human health and disease. This was codified as the central dogma of molecular biology over 50 years ago, and is exemplified in the schematic below. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Given its essential role, we believe mRNA could be used to create a new category of medicines with
significant potential to improve the lives of patients. Over the last 40 years, the biotechnology industry has created a new category of drugs based on recombinant protein technology. These drugs rely on secreted proteins, including antibodies and
protein replacements, to treat a wide range of diseases. Today this category of drugs accounts for over $200 billion in annual worldwide sales. However, intracellular and membrane proteins represent as much as two-thirds of the proteins in humans,
and are largely beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology. Based on the ability of mRNA to produce these proteins directly in cells, we believe that mRNA-based medicines have the potential to help patients in ways that could equal or exceed
the impact of recombinant protein-based drugs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The structure of mRNA </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Messenger RNA is a linear polymer comprising four monomers called nucleotides: adenosine (A), guanosine (G), cytosine (C), and uridine (U). Within the region
of the molecule that codes for a protein, or the coding region, the sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of three-letter words called codons. The first codon, or start codon (AUG), signals where the ribosome should start
protein synthesis. To know what protein to make, the ribosome then progresses along the mRNA one codon at a time, appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein. To end protein synthesis, three different codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) serve
as stop signals, telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis. In total, there are 64 potential codons, but only 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins; therefore multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of protein production is called translation because the ribosome is reading in one language (a sequence of codons) and outputting in another
language (a sequence of amino acids). As shown in the figure below, the coding region is analogous to a sentence in English. Much like a start codon, a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence. Codons within the coding region resemble
groups of letters representing words. The end of the sentence is signaled by a period in English, or a stop codon for mRNA. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

polymer comprised of four monomers called nucleotides: adenosine (A), guanosine (G), cytosine (C), and uridine (U). Within the region of the mRNA molecule that serves as instructions for protein synthesis, the coding region, the exact sequence of
these four nucleotides forms a language made up of three-letter words called codons. One codon, the start codon (AUG), serves to signal where the ribosome should start protein synthesis. To know what protein to make, the ribosome then progresses
along the mRNA one codon at a time, appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain. Because the ribosome is reading in one language (a sequence of codons) and outputting in another language (a sequence of amino acids), this
process is called translation. Finally, three different codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) can serve as stop signals, telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis. The production of proteins from mRNA sequences is called translation and is used
to make all human proteins. The production of mRNA from DNA is called transcription. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As shown in the figure below, the coding region in an mRNA molecule
is analogous to a sentence in English. The start codon indicates the start of the protein, much like a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence. Codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words. The end of
the sentence is signaled by a period in English, or a stop codon for mRNA. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In every cell, hundreds of thousands of mRNAs make hundreds of millions of proteins every day. A typical protein contains
200-600 amino acids; therefore a typical mRNA coding region ranges from 600-1,800 nucleotides. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the coding region, mRNAs contain four other
key features: (1)&nbsp;the 5&#146; untranslated region or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">5&#146;-UTR;</FONT> (2)&nbsp;the 3&#146; untranslated region or 3&#146;-UTR; (3)&nbsp;the 5&#146; cap; and (4)&nbsp;a 3&#146; polyadenosine, or poly-A, tail.
The sequence of nucleotides in the 5&#146;-UTR influences how efficiently the ribosome initiates protein synthesis, whereas the sequence of nucleotides in the 3&#146;-UTR contains information about which cell types should translate that mRNA and how
long the mRNA should last. The 5&#146; cap and 3&#146; poly-A tail enhance ribosome engagement and protect the mRNA from attack by intracellular enzymes that digest mRNA from its ends. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of this biology, mRNA has several key features. First, mRNA is exquisitely specific. There is a one-to-one correspondence between an mRNA molecule
and the protein dictated by the coding sequence. Second, the biological effects of mRNA are amplified. Because each mRNA copy can be translated thousands of times, we believe that in some cases, a small number of mRNA copies per cell may be
sufficient to induce a pharmacologic </P>

production will stop and the biological effects generally can be reversed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Decades of academic investigation have uncovered the basic mechanisms of mRNA
translation. Parallel efforts have uncovered how the innate immune system determines self-mRNA versus foreign RNA from RNA-based viruses. We are grateful for the deep scientific foundation established by these pioneers. Yet as we seek to develop
mRNA into medicines we often find ourselves at the frontiers of current understanding. Therefore, we invest in both applied and basic research, seeking to advance both the state of our technology and the state of the scientific community&#146;s
understanding of mRNA. Examples of advances in mRNA science that combine nucleotide chemistry, sequence engineering, and targeting elements are described below. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The innate immune system has evolved to protect cells from foreign RNA, such as viral RNA, by inducing inflammation and suppressing mRNA translation once
detected. Many cells surveil their environment through sensors called toll-like-receptors, or TLRs. These include types that are activated by the presence of double-stranded RNA (TLR3) or uridine containing RNA fragments (TLR7, TLR8). Additionally,
all cells have cytosolic double-stranded RNA, or dsRNA, sensors, including retinoic acid inducible gene-I, or RIG-I that are sensitive to foreign RNA inside the cell. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The immune and cellular response to mRNA is complex, context specific, and often linked to the sensing of uridine. To minimize undesired immune responses to
our potential mRNA medicines, our platform employs chemically-modified uridine nucleotides to minimize recognition by both immune cell sensors such as TLR3/7/8, and broadly-distributed cytosolic receptors such as RIG-I. mRNA produced using our
synthesis technologies and containing unmodified uridine results in significant upregulation of secreted cytokines such as IP-10, as shown in the figure below. Administration of monocyte-derived macrophages, or MDMs, with unmodified mRNA formulated
in LNPs results in an increased ratio of IP-10 transcripts relative to a housekeeping gene, HPRT. By substituting unmodified uridine with a modified uridine, we can substantially reduce immune cell activation in this assay. The control contains only
transfection agent and no mRNA. In multiple preclinical experiments we have demonstrated reduced immune cell activation, including of B cells, lower immunoglobulin secretion, and lower cytokine expression when administering mRNA made with modified
uridine versus unmodified uridine. To date, when deploying these technologies we have yet to observe dose-limiting toxicity attributable to the mRNA encoding proteins from our drug substance even at the exaggerated doses in IND-enabling GLP
toxicology programs. Importantly, in preclinical testing, our chemically-modified uridine has not significantly affected the ribosome&#146;s ability to read and translate the mRNA sequence. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">mRNA exists transiently in the cytoplasm, during which time it can be translated into thousands of proteins before eventually being degraded. Our platform
applies bioinformatic, biochemical, and biological screening capabilities, most of which have been invented internally that aim to optimize the amount of protein produced per mRNA. We have identified proprietary sequences for the 5&#146;-UTR that
have been observed to increase the likelihood that a ribosome bound to the 5&#146;-end of the mRNA transcript will find the desired start codon and reliably initiate translation of the coding region. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We additionally design the nucleotide sequence of the coding region to maximize its successful translation into protein. As previously described, there are
often multiple codons that encode for a specific amino acid. The amount of protein produced by an mRNA sequence is known to be partly determined by the codons it uses, with certain codons being more or less common in endogenous mRNAs. We have found
that the amount of protein produced is also determined by the secondary structure of mRNA, or the propensity of mRNA to fold on itself, with more structured mRNAs producing more protein. We designed a set of sequences which independently varied
codon usage and structure of the mRNA. As shown in the figure below, protein expression in the Alpha mouse liver 12, or AML12, cell line is highest for sequences containing more commonly occurring codons and also more structured mRNA. Both codon
usage and structure have an independent and additive effect on protein expression, shown as mean expression (solid line), as measured by fluorescence of the expressed protein, with 95% confidence interval in gray. The total expression area under the
curve, or AUC, and standard error of the mean for AUC are shown for each quadrant, in relative fluorescence units per hour, or RFU/h. By optimizing translation initiation and efficiency, we have further increased the average number of full-length
desired proteins expressed per molecule mRNA. This permits us to reduce the mRNA doses required to achieve the same therapeutic benefit. </P>

minimize or prevent potential off-target effects, our platform employs technologies that regulate mRNA translation in select cell types. Cells often contain short RNA sequences, called microRNAs or miRNAs, that bind to mRNA to regulate protein
translation at the mRNA level. Different cell types have different concentrations of specific microRNAs, in effect giving cells a microRNA signature. microRNA binding directly to mRNA effectively silences or reduces mRNA translation and promotes
mRNA degradation. We design microRNA binding sites into the 3&#146;-UTR of our potential mRNA medicines so that if our mRNA is delivered to cells with such microRNAs, it will be minimally translated and rapidly degraded. </P>

the overall composition, or mix of components, contributes to the properties of each LNP system. LNPs containing mRNA injected into the body rapidly bind proteins that can drive uptake of LNPs into cells. Once internalized in endosomes within cells,
the LNPs are designed to escape the endosome and release their mRNA cargo into the cell cytoplasm, where the mRNA can be translated to make a protein and have the desired therapeutic effect. Any mRNA and LNP components that do not escape the

pharmacology. The figure below shows a recent example in a mouse model that recapitulates metabolic defects in propionic acidemia, or PA. In this rare disease, a defect in one or both of two different subunits (PCCA and PCCB) of the mitochondrial
enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase results in accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 2-methylcitrate, or 2MC. In mice hypomorphic for the PCCA subunit, monthly IV administration of mRNAs encoding PCCA and PCCB formulated in our proprietary LNP
(mRNA-3927) resulted in a significant and sustained lowering of 2MC throughout the duration of the 6-month study compared to control (luciferase) mRNA (1 mg/kg, n=6/group). </P>

today </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality because we believed this modality faced lower technical hurdles, relative to other
areas. Our early formulations of mRNA tended to stimulate the immune system, which would present a challenge to therapeutics but was a desired feature for vaccines. In addition, many potential prophylactic vaccine antigens are well-characterized,
allowing us to reduce biology risk. Lastly, the dosing regimens for vaccines require as few as one or two administrations, and generally involve relatively low doses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our first programs in this modality we chose our H10N8 and H7N9 pandemic influenza vaccines, each requiring expression of a single membrane protein. We
chose to pursue two programs in two separate, but parallel, clinical trials to establish the flexibility of our platform. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When both programs met our
goals for safety, tolerability, and pharmacology, we accelerated and expanded our vaccine pipeline to include multiple commercially meaningful and increasingly complex vaccines. These included a combination vaccine, designed to protect against two
unrelated respiratory viruses, hMPV and PIV3, and a vaccine that combines six different mRNAs, our CMV vaccine, to express a complex pentameric antigen. We also sought strategic alliances with Defense Advanced Research Projects, or DARPA, Biomedical
Advanced Research Development Authority, or BARDA, and Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., or Merck, to allow us to rapidly expand our pipeline and complement our capabilities with their expertise. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over time, we have taken on more challenging applications and technological hurdles with each successive modality, but we have also tried to build upon our
prior experiences to manage risk. For example, in our cancer vaccines modality, we are now applying our technology to elicit T cell responses to potentially recognize and eradicate cancer as a logical extension of our prophylactic vaccines modality.
Having demonstrated local expression of protein in our vaccines, we expanded into local therapeutic applications. For example, in our intra-tumoral immuno-oncology modality, we are seeking to use local expression to drive anti-cancer T cell
responses by transforming tumor microenvironments. We can also use local expression to drive regenerative processes as in our VEGF-A program. Most recently, we have expanded into two new modalities that use systemic delivery of mRNA to encode
secreted or intracellular proteins. We have moved multiple programs in these areas into development for the treatment of diseases as varied as rare genetic disorders, preventing viral infections, or treating heart failure. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As our scientists create new mRNA concepts, they can design mRNAs for research and testing, within days, using our proprietary systems. We utilize the
software-like property of mRNA in our proprietary, web-based Drug Design Studio. Our scientists request mRNAs for a specific protein, and the protein target is automatically converted to an initial optimized mRNA sequence. Using our Sequence
Designer module, they can tailor entire mRNAs from the 5&#146;-UTR to the coding region to the 3&#146;-UTR based on our ever-improving proprietary learnings. The mRNA sequence is then further optimized using our proprietary bioinformatics
algorithms. Our digital ordering then ensures rapid and accurate transmission of sequences to our modular synthesis robotics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Our high throughput
systems facilitate rapid synthesis of research grade mRNA </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once our scientists design mRNAs, we make them at a small scale to test them in cells or in
animal models to see if our ideas will work. We integrated the Drug Design Studio mRNA sequence into a modular synthesis system comprised of custom high-throughput automation for making up to 1,000 orders of unique mRNA sequences and formulations
per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks at 1-10 mg per lot, the amounts required for testing in cells or animal models. This has accelerated our learnings by allowing us to test many different mRNAs in parallel. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Our Norwood manufacturing site provides modular and automated capacity that can scale with our pipeline </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Manufacturing is strategically important to us, and we believe we need to control a significant portion of our manufacturing supply chain. We initially used an
outsourced global supply chain to make our multi-component mRNA products. However, we believe that managing quality, supply, and timing in such a supply chain for cGMP material could increase our overall business risk. Accordingly, we elected in
2016 to build our own manufacturing facility. We opened our newly constructed 200,000 square foot Norwood manufacturing facility in July 2018, and brought multiple cGMP suites online, thereby providing integration of our supply chain from raw
materials to filled vials at a single site. We can make mRNA, lipids, and LNPs at this site to control quality and supply, while also potentially creating new manufacturing intellectual property. We can readily flex the capacity at our Norwood
facility via its modular systems to produce up to 100 cGMP lots per year. This capacity will support our current pipeline, will enable significant future pipeline expansion, and, under certain scenarios, could serve some commercial supply needs.

grown to include nine programs, all of which are vaccines against viruses. The goal of any vaccine is to safely pre-expose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen, called an antigen, so that the immune system is prepared
to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future, and prevent infection or disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within this modality, our portfolio includes programs for both

Prevention, or CDC, estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322&nbsp;million Americans from falling ill, 21&nbsp;million hospitalizations, 732,000 deaths, $295 billion of direct costs, and $1.3
trillion in social costs. The commercial opportunity for vaccines is significant, with more than $35 billion in annual worldwide sales of vaccines, and with 16 different vaccine franchises each generating more than $500 million in annual worldwide
sales in 2017. More innovative vaccines have been able to achieve pricing per regimen generally ranging from 5 to 20 times that of seasonal flu vaccines. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens, defined below. This modality has two
programs currently for neoantigen vaccines, a personalized cancer vaccine, or PCV, program and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called KRAS, both conducted in collaboration with Merck. The goal of a cancer vaccine is to
safely expose the patient&#146;s immune system to tumor related antigens, known as neoantigens, to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response. Our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mRNA to express
neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via T cells that recognize those neoantigens, and therefore the tumor. These neoantigens can either be unique to a patient, as in the case of our personalized cancer
vaccine program, or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients, as in the case of our KRAS vaccine program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our cancer vaccines

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">More than 1.6&nbsp;million new cancer cases and approximately 600,000&nbsp;deaths due to cancer were predicted in the United States for 2017. Despite the
recent success of checkpoint inhibitors, the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available
therapies. In addition, treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms, principally the local immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells, which prevent either access to or recognition by T cells. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T&nbsp;cell therapies, have demonstrated that
powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific T&nbsp;cells. We believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a
patient&#146;s T&nbsp;cells that recognize tumor neoantigens. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Cancer vaccines: Product features </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This section describes the pipeline that has emerged thus far from the combination of our strategy, our platform, our infrastructure, and the resources we have
amassed. Complete descriptions of our programs are found in the section of this prospectus titled &#147;Business&#151;Program Descriptions.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In late
2014, we nominated our first development candidate and today, have brought forward 21 development candidates, with 10 now in clinical trials on three different continents. More than 755 subjects have been dosed with our mRNA investigational
medicines in clinical trials since December 2015. Our diverse pipeline comprises programs across six modalities and a broad range of therapeutic areas. A modality is a group of potential mRNA medicines with shared product features, and the
associated combination of mRNA technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing processes. Aspects of our pipeline have been supported through strategic alliances, including with AstraZeneca, Merck, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, or Vertex, and
government-sponsored organizations and private foundations focused on global health initiatives, including BARDA, DARPA, and the Bill&nbsp;&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our selection process for advancing new development candidates reflects both program-specific considerations as well as portfolio-wide considerations.
Program-specific criteria include, among other relevant factors, the severity of the unmet medical need, the biology risk of our chosen target or disease, the feasibility of clinical development, the costs of development, and the commercial
opportunity. Portfolio-wide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform components within a modality, thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs in the modality and in
some cases in other modalities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our pipeline as of October 2018 is shown below in two formats, with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology
addressed by our mRNA pipeline programs, and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs. We believe the 21 programs in our pipeline represent only an initial wave of potential development candidates,
and that our platform over time may yield both multiple new programs within our existing modalities and the potential for multiple programs in new modalities. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Using our platform, we have found solutions to many scientific and technical challenges in order to develop the desirable features of our potential mRNA
medicines for different applications. A &#147;modality&#148; refers to a group of potential mRNA medicines with shared product features, and the associated combination of enabling mRNA technologies, delivery technologies, and manufacturing
processes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each of our modalities is designed to overcome the challenges of delivering the right amount of mRNA to the right tissue at the right times
across a variety of applications. In advancing our platform technologies and identifying new product features for novel mRNA medicines, we may designate additional modalities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality as we believed there would be lower technical hurdles for vaccines compared to therapeutics. Early
formulations of mRNA tended to stimulate the immune system, which is a desired feature for a vaccine, but not therapeutics. In addition, antigens for many viruses tend to be well-characterized and of lower biology risk. Also, dosing regimens for
vaccines can require as few as one or two administrations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS IN OUR PROPHYLACTIC VACCINES MODALITY </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We designed our prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent or control infectious diseases. Since we nominated our first program in late 2014, this modality has
grown to include nine programs, all of which are vaccines against viruses. The goal of any vaccine is to safely pre-expose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen, called an antigen, so that the immune system is prepared
to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future, and prevent infection or disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within this modality, our portfolio includes programs for both
commercial and global health uses. We have strategic alliances with Merck on select commercial vaccines, and with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, on
global health vaccine programs. Our prophylactic vaccines pipeline is shown below. </P>

Prevention estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322&nbsp;million Americans from falling ill, 21&nbsp;million hospitalizations, 732,000 deaths, $295 billion of direct costs, and $1.3 trillion in

protection based on the serum hemagglutination inhibition, or HAI, assay. HAI titers of 40 or above are associated with 50% to 70% protection against influenza. However, such correlates are
generally only available for approved vaccines. As a result, new vaccines generally, but not always, have to demonstrate efficacy against clinical disease before being approved. Our first two programs in this modality are H10N8 and H7N9 vaccines for
an established antigen with HAI clinical correlates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Typically, subjects require only a limited number of administrations of a vaccine to confer
long-lasting protection. Many of our mRNA vaccines are developed to be administered in two doses, one to prime the immune response and the second to boost it. In cases where populations have been exposed to the virus previously, such as with many
respiratory viruses, a subject might be administered a single dose of an mRNA vaccine. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our potential mRNA vaccines will have a more
standardized manufacturing process compared to traditional vaccines that would provide considerable advantages. Current approaches include attenuation and replication of live viruses and cell-culture methods to produce recombinant antigens. These
approaches require considerable customization compared to the standardized process of producing mRNA vaccines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the inherent characteristics of
mRNA, coupled with our strategy to execute at scale, will allow us to bring potential mRNA vaccines to the clinic in a relatively short period of time. We have chosen to be methodical for our early programs to understand the technology risks within
the modality. If needed, as in the case of a pandemic, we could potentially exploit the scalability of mRNA medicines and our infrastructure to rapidly advance a potential mRNA vaccine to the clinic. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is one of the most common causes of respiratory disease in infants and the elderly. More than 86,000 children and about
177,000 older adults are hospitalized due to RSV associated respiratory infections each year in the United States. To date, no effective vaccine to prevent RSV has been approved, and the only approved prophylaxis treatment is limited to the
monoclonal antibody palivizumab, marketed as Synagis in the United States for pediatric patients at high risk for RSV infection. In collaboration with Merck, we designed mRNA-1777 to encode a membrane-anchored version of stabilized prefusion F
protein, the main target of potently neutralizing and protective antibodies. This vaccine is administered as a single dose with no boost. The Phase 1 trial is currently ongoing in Australia, for which we are the sponsor. Merck has initiated plans
for a Phase 2a trial, for which Merck will be the sponsor. In addition, we are working with Merck to identify and advance improvements to the RSV vaccine. </P>

transmitted primarily via aerosolized droplets from an infected person, or via contamination of environmental surfaces with infectious secretions. Following introduction of RSV into the nose or upper respiratory tract, the virus replicates primarily
in the ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium. Upper respiratory symptoms typically begin within several days of exposure. In healthy adults, the infection may remain confined to the upper respiratory tract. However, in those with compromised
immune systems, such as premature infants, the elderly, or individuals with underlying respiratory disease, lower respiratory tract infections commonly occur and may manifest as wheezing, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, hospitalization or even death.
Infections with RSV follow a seasonal pattern, occurring primarily in the Northern hemisphere between the months of November and April, and in the Southern hemisphere primarily between March and October. </P>

membrane, and the conformational change from prefusion to postfusion drives virus fusion with a host cell. The majority of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent people are directed to epitopes present only on the prefusion
conformation of the F protein. The prefusion state of the F protein elicits a superior neutralizing antibody response compared to the postfusion state in animal studies conducted by others. A schematic of the prefusion F protein on the surface of a
host cell, with sites recognized by neutralizing antibodies, is depicted in the figure below; the inset on the left of the figure shows the intended design of the mRNA formulated in LNP, and the inset on the right shows the intended prefusion F

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This 200-subject study is fully enrolled and all subjects have been dosed. As of April 2018, we have the
majority of data through three months (90 days) post-vaccination for younger subjects in dose levels one and two, and for older subjects in doses one, two, and three. Based on the interim data as of April 2018, dose levels one, two, and three of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mRNA-1777</FONT> were observed to elicit a humoral immune response as measured by neutralizing antibody titers against RSV A, neutralizing antibody titers against RSV B (dose level three only, dose levels one and two have
yet to be assayed), absolute serum antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein and RSV postfusion F protein, and competing antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein in a dose-dependent manner up to dose level two in both younger and older subjects.
The immune response measured by neutralizing antibody titers against RSV A in older adults that received dose level three of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mRNA-1777</FONT> was not higher than that of the subjects that received dose level two. We
have observed an increase in neutralizing antibody titers relative to placebo in younger adult subjects in panel A and older adult subjects in panel B who received our RSV vaccine, as shown in the figure below. In the figure, geometric mean titer
and 95% confidence interval are depicted by time for neutralizing antibody titers against RSV A for older and younger subjects. At day ninety, between 10 and 19 healthy younger subjects and between 11 and 27 healthy older subjects were tested at
each dose level. Based on the interim data and other considerations, Merck has initiated planning for a Phase&nbsp;2a trial. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Our CMV program targets congenital CMV infections to reduce or prevent birth defects </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Congenital cytomegalovirus, or CMV, infection is the leading cause of birth defects in the United States. Despite several attempts, to date, there is no
vaccine approved to prevent congenital transmission of CMV. We believe that in addition to the glycoprotein B, or gB, protein antigen, a successful CMV vaccine would need to include the Pentamer, a 5-protein membrane complex required for epithelial,
endothelial, and myeloid cell infection by the virus. A CMV vaccine containing the Pentamer as a recombinant protein or a replication defective virus is complex to make and scale. We used our platform to generate a mRNA vaccine designed to make the
Pentamer in its natural membrane-bound conformation. This investigational medicine is designed to prevent or control CMV infection and includes five mRNAs encoding for the Pentamer, as well as one mRNA encoding for CMV gB that has previously
demonstrated partial clinical efficacy. Our program is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>CMV (mRNA-1647):
Disease overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CMV is a major cause of birth defects with no approved vaccine </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human CMV is a common human pathogen and member of the herpes virus family. Seropositivity, demonstrating prior exposure to virus, increases with age and is
approximately 40-60% in women of child-bearing potential in the United States. However, general awareness of CMV is not high. Less than 10-20% of adults are aware of CMV and most healthy adults after initial (primary) CMV infection do not have
symptoms. However, approximately 0.6-0.7% of newborns are congenitally infected by CMV annually in industrialized countries. Congenital CMV results from infected mothers transmitting the virus to their unborn child and it is the leading cause of
birth defects, with approximately 25,000 newborns per year in the United States infected. Birth defects occur in approximately 20% of infected babies and include permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities, which can include hearing loss (often
permanent), vision impairment, varying degrees of learning disability, decreased muscle strength and coordination, and even death. Some studies report approximately one-third of infants with severe congenital disease will die within the first year
of life, and the survivors, their caregivers, and health systems bear significant long-term burdens. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is currently no available vaccine for CMV, and
many previous attempts at developing a vaccine to reduce or prevent congenital transmission have been missing a key antigen, the Pentamer. We believe the Pentamer is critical for the infection of epithelial, endothelial, and myeloid cells by the
virus. We believe the Pentamer was not included in certain prior recombinant protein vaccine attempts due to the complexity of producing it as a multi-unit antigen complex. Prior vaccine studies demonstrated insufficient efficacy against CMV
infection and limited durability of immune response. A vaccine that leads to durable immunity in women of child-bearing age would address a critical unmet need in the prevention of congenital CMV infection. </P>

combine a traditional target antigen (gB) with the Pentamer in order to specifically focus the immune system on these important antigens. We believe this gives us greater potential to produce neutralizing antibodies that can block CMV transmission
from the mother to the fetus. Our approach to block transmission could either be: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

cytomegalovirus immune globulin from pooled plasma of CMV seropositive donors. The table below shows the neutralization antibody titers in epithelial cells for escalating vaccine doses in mice, demonstrating our ability to generate neutralizing

dose-selection phases A and B. Only CMV-seronegative subjects are enrolled into the dose-escalation phases, and both CMV-seronegative and -seropositive subjects are enrolled at a 1:1 ratio into the dose-selection phases. Dose-escalation phase A
evaluated mRNA-1647 manufactured with the process originally filed in the IND, and dose-escalation phase B is now evaluating mRNA-1647 manufactured with a modified process. For each dose-escalation phase, there is sequential enrollment of subjects
into three dose levels of study vaccine or placebo, starting at the lowest dose level. Internal safety review of all subjects at each dose level will permit enrollment of subjects into the next dose level. For each dose-escalation phase, the safety
monitoring committee, or SMC, will review the safety data from all subjects after their second vaccination to permit enrollment into the corresponding dose-selection phase. Since dose-escalation phase A included the mRNA-1647 manufactured using the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human metapneumovirus, or hMPV, and human parainfluenza virus 3, or PIV3, are important causes of respiratory tract infections in children and have led to
increasing rates of hospitalization over the past few years. Despite the substantial impact hMPV and PIV3 have on human health, attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to RSV. To date, no vaccine to prevent hMPV or PIV3
infections has been approved. Our platform allows us to combine mRNAs encoding antigens for the two pathogens in one combination vaccine, enabling a single vaccine that could protect against both respiratory infections. In our approach, we utilize
mRNA sequences encoding for the membrane F proteins for each of the viruses. We have developed experience with the related F protein from our RSV program with Merck. mRNA-1653 is currently being tested in a Phase 1 trial in the United States. </P>

although this RNA virus has been determined to be one of the more frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. hMPV has been detected in 4% to 15% of patients with acute respiratory infections. hMPV causes disease primarily in
young children but can also infect adults, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Clinical signs of infection range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">life-threatening</FONT> severe
bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Though PIV3 related infections were identified in the past, their burden to patients and hospitals has been elevated over the past few years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is no approved vaccine for PIV3 although this RNA virus is recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections in children. Infections from
parainfluenza virus, or PIV, account for up to 7% of acute respiratory infections among children younger than 5&nbsp;years. Of the four PIV types identified, PIV3 most frequently results in infections and leads to the more serious lower respiratory
tract infections compared to the other three PIV types. hMPV was discovered in 2001 and identified as another leading cause of respiratory infection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
majority of hMPV or PIV3-associated hospitalizations in children occur under the age of 2 years. Despite the substantial impact hMPV and PIV3 have on human health, attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to RSV. Hospitalizations
due to hMPV or PIV3 infections have risen, and we believe that a single vaccine intended for active immunization of infants and toddler against both hMPV and PIV3 would be valuable. Previous attempts at developing a vaccine have focused on only hMPV
or PIV alone with no known attempts at a combination vaccine. </P>

and could eventually address pandemics for these viruses. We have also gone from mRNA sequence to a first-in-human trial for Zika vaccine in twelve months. We have leveraged our learnings to rapidly advance a potential mRNA vaccine for a Zika

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Influenza is one of the most variable and deadly infectious diseases, ranging from 12,000-56,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. The antigens in
circulating seasonal influenza strains change slightly, which is called antigenic drift, from one year to the next, necessitating a change in the vaccine to match the new strains. Potential pandemic influenza strains can arise very quickly from
substantial changes in antigens, which is called antigenic shift, and because pre-existing immunity is nonexistent in some populations, they can be pathogenic. Addressing a potential pandemic requires the ability to produce an effective vaccine
rapidly. We believe that our platform enables the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines. As a proof of concept, we developed vaccines for H10N8 and H7N9 avian influenza strains, where there is a quantitative correlate for protection in
humans (hemagglutinin inhibition, or HAI, titer of <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>1:40). We have observed tolerability and immunogenicity in Phase 1 clinical trials for both mRNA vaccines for H10N8 and H7N9 and have published the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Influenza A is an RNA virus, with a genome packed into eight individual gene segments that code for at least eleven functional proteins needed for infection,
replication, and evasion of host antiviral responses. The two major glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virion are hemagglutinin, or HA, and neuraminidase, or NA, both of which are crucial for infection. HA mediates viral entry into host
cells by binding to sialic acid containing receptors on the host cell surface and causing fusion of viral and host endosomal membranes. NA mediates enzymatic cleavage of the viral receptor at late stages of infection, allowing for the release of
progeny virions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Influenza A viruses infect a variety of species, including birds, pigs, sea mammals, and humans. Wild aquatic birds serve as the
reservoir of influenza A viruses infecting avian and mammalian species. Although many of these viruses are non-pathogenic in birds and most do not infect humans, in recent decades, some avian influenza viruses such as H10N8 and H7N9 have crossed the
species barrier to cause human disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been five epidemics of human infection due to H7N9, totaling over 1,500 cases, with mortality rates of
34-47%. To date, there have been three reported cases of H10N8, of which two have been fatal. For both H10N8 and H7N9, severe or fatal infections are characterized by rapid progression to respiratory failure within days of initial symptoms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are efforts ongoing to develop a H7N9 vaccine and a universal flu vaccine that covers H10N8. However, we believe the use of traditional methods to
produce these vaccines can lead to several shortcomings in the vaccine. These include: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Phase 1 trial for H10N8 vaccine has met its objectives of describing the safety and tolerability profile of mRNA-1440 vs. placebo including capturing
solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events. The Phase 1 trial for H10N8 vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed 100% of the subjects demonstrating hemagglutinin inhibition, or HAI, titer <FONT

provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, we evaluated safety and immunogenicity of IM dose
levels of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 400 &micro;g on a two-dose vaccination schedule on Day 1 and Day 21. We also evaluated intradermal, or ID, dose levels of 25 and 50 &micro;g on a two-dose vaccination schedule on Day 1 and Day&nbsp;21. The study
objectives were safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity by HAI, and microneutralization, or MN, assays. 201 subjects were enrolled in this study, of which 145 received IM vaccination and 56 received ID vaccination. Of the 145 subjects in the IM
vaccination group, there were 30, 30, 24, 23, and 3 subjects in the 25, 50, 75, 100, and 400 &micro;g dose level groups, respectively. 35 subjects received the placebo. The Phase 1 trial was conducted with the name of the intervention listed as

chose not to proceed with its completion because the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data generated supported further development of the 100&nbsp;&micro;g dose. Intradermal vaccination was associated with high rates of solicited adverse

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Phase 1 trial for H7N9 vaccine has met its objectives of assessing the safety and tolerability profile of mRNA-1851 vs. placebo including capturing
solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events. The Phase 1 trial for H7N9 vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed 96% of the subjects demonstrating HAI titer <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 1:40
at day 43 for the 25 &micro;g dose where HAI <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 1:40 is regarded as a quantitative measure for protection from influenza. We believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development
if we choose to with additional government or other funding. The Phase 1 study for H7N9 is ongoing in the United States for long-term safety. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study is evaluating intramuscular, or IM,
dose levels of 10, 25, and 50 &micro;g using two vaccination schedules (Day 1, Day 22 and Day 1, Month 6). The objectives are safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity by HAI and MN assays. 156 subjects were enrolled in this study. 30 subjects per
dose cohort received two doses of 10 &micro;g, 25 &micro;g, and 50 &micro;g at days 1 and 22. 10 subjects per dose cohort received one dose of 10, 25, and 50 &micro;g at day one and a total of 9 of those subjects received a second dose at 6 months
(data not shown). 36 subjects received placebo. A total of 10 subjects withdrew from the study. The Phase 1 trial was conducted with the name of the intervention listed as VAL-339851, in accordance with our legacy naming convention. We have since
changed our naming convention and have adopted mRNA-1851 in place of VAL-339851. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Doses up to 50 &micro;g administered IM to patients that received

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Zika is an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus, in which infection during pregnancy has been linked to severe brain damage in infants with congenital
infection and Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome in adults. To date, no vaccine to prevent Zika infection has been approved. In September 2016, we were awarded a contract with BARDA to be reimbursed up to approximately $125 million for the development
of a Zika mRNA vaccine. In order to rapidly respond to a potential epidemic, we developed mRNA-1325, which went from mRNA sequence design to first-in-human clinical testing in twelve months. In addition, we also developed a second Zika vaccine,
mRNA-1893. mRNA-1893, at 1/20 of the dose, demonstrated better protection in non-human primates, as compared to mRNA-1325. mRNA-1325 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States and we are planning for a Phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1893.
Based on the preclinical and clinical data, in collaboration with BARDA, we will determine which mRNA investigational medicine will be advanced for further clinical development. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>We faced a Zika epidemic in 2015 for which there were no vaccines or treatments </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Zika virus is a single stranded RNA virus of the flaviviridae family. It was first isolated in a rhesus macaque in the Zika Forest, Uganda in 1947 and the
first human case was documented in 1952. Seroepidemiology data suggest that it is endemic to regions of Africa and Asia where the <I>Aedes</I> mosquito vectors are found. Zika virus is predominantly spread by mosquitos from the <I>Aedes</I> genus,
but it can also be transmitted congenitally, sexually, and through blood donation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2007, a Zika infection outbreak progressed across the Pacific
islands. It arrived in Brazil in 2015 and the epidemic spread across the Americas. This led to the World Health Organization, or WHO, declaring it a public health emergency of international concern in 2016. During the period, there were tens of
thousands of cases of microcephaly and congenital Zika syndrome reported in infants and of resulting neurological sequelae such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome reported in adults. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Zika infection is usually asymptomatic or mild in adults, leading to fever, rash and conjunctivitis. However, infection of women during pregnancy can result
in devastating microcephaly in newborns. Microcephaly is a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head and brain, associated with lifelong neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, intellectual disability, balance problems, and dwarfism / short
stature, resulting in significant disability and requiring lifelong support. To date, over a million cases of Zika have been officially reported in Latin America. Since most of the cases are asymptomatic, we believe the actual number of cases may be
far higher. International travel means that Zika infection has the potential to take on global significance. While the number of cases has declined in the past couple of years, there is currently no treatment or vaccine available for the Zika virus
to prevent and respond to potential future epidemics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, there is no approved vaccine for Zika. Designing and synthesizing conformationally
correct protein antigen vaccines, attenuated or vectored live viral vaccines, or inactivated vaccines is time consuming and challenging. These traditional vaccine approaches have therefore found it difficult to respond fast enough to the emerging
Zika epidemic. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Zika vaccine (mRNA-1325 and mRNA-1893): Our product concept </B></P>

contains the same mRNA sequence as mRNA-1325 and now formulated in our proprietary LNP. Continued efforts at identifying different mRNA sequences with improved immunogenicity led to mRNA-1893, a sequence distinct from mRNA-1325 that increases
production of Zika VLPs and generates enhanced immunogenicity and protection in preclinical animal models compared to mRNA-1325. mRNA-1893 is also formulated in our proprietary LNP. mRNA-1706 was discontinued in favor of mRNA-1893, which has been
shown to have more activity. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Our Chikungunya vaccine has generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity for the Phase 1 clinical study through approximately six
months post dosing; we aim to address a public health need with this vaccine </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Chikungunya virus represents a serious public health problem in tropical
and sub-tropical regions with over 3&nbsp;million cases globally. While it is rarely fatal, it can cause long-lasting and debilitating pain in multiple joints from polyarthralgia as well as serious neurological conditions. To date, no vaccine to
prevent Chikungunya infection has been approved. Effective mosquito control has proven challenging, even in higher income countries. We believe our platform is well-suited to address this disease, as we can produce and deliver mRNA encoding the
entire Chikungunya virus structural polyprotein (capsid and envelope proteins) to cells, which in turn produce and secrete Chikungunya virus-like particles, or Chikungunya VLPs, known to be robust inducers of protective neutralizing antibody
responses. This program is supported by DARPA for a Phase 1 trial which is being conducted in the United States. The Phase 1 trial for Chikungunya vaccine in the United States is fully enrolled and has met its objectives of describing the safety and
tolerability profile of mRNA-1388 versus placebo through approximately six months post dosing including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events. The Phase 1 trial for Chikungunya vaccine has also demonstrated
immunogenicity for the first part of the trial and we have observed 100% seroresponse for subjects at the 100 &micro;g dose level 28 days post the second dose. We have also observed a durable response for the 100 &micro;g dose, with 13 of 14
subjects at day 196 with neutralizing antibody titers above the seroresponse threshold. The second part of the trial to measure persistence of response at one year post dosing is ongoing. We believe the data provides support to advance the program
in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Chikungunya vaccine (mRNA-1388): Disease overview </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne RNA alphavirus posing a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. While Chikungunya has been
present in Africa for centuries, recent outbreaks and epidemics in new regions have arisen due to the expanding distribution of the <I>Aedes</I> mosquito. A Chikungunya epidemic began in 2004 in Kenya, spread to India and was exported to nearly all
regions of the world and brought Chikungunya to the attention of the western world. As of April 2016, Chikungunya cases had been reported in over 100&nbsp;countries and territories around the world, including more than 45 countries and territories
throughout the Americas. Chikungunya virus infection causes disease, characterized by an acute onset of fever, rash, myalgia, and sometimes debilitating polyarthralgia, giving the virus its name, which means &#147;that which bends up&#148; when
translated from Makonde. It is rarely fatal, but neurological sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic arthralgia have been associated with infection. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family with a positive-strand RNA genome. The viral structural proteins are naturally expressed as a
single polyprotein followed by subsequent cleavage by viral and cellular proteases into capsid (C)&nbsp;and envelope (E)&nbsp;glycoproteins E3, E2, 6k, and E1. The E proteins are major targets of protective neutralizing antibody responses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are currently no approved vaccines to treat or prevent Chikungunya infection or disease, and effective mosquito control has proven challenging, even in
higher income countries. Currently, infected individuals are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve symptoms. Therefore, there is a need for a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The mRNA-1388 vaccine consists of a single mRNA encoding the full native structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6k-E1) that is naturally processed into C and E
proteins, which assemble into VLPs and are released from cells. The E proteins on these VLPs are the major target of neutralizing and protective antibodies, that, in the context of natural infection, can provide essentially life-long immunity to
reinfection. The C protein provides structure to the VLP and contains T cell epitopes that could contribute to protective immune responses. The mRNA is encapsulated in a legacy LNP. An illustration of our approach is shown in the figure below. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens, defined below. This modality has two
programs currently for neoantigen vaccines, a personalized cancer vaccine, or PCV, program, and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called KRAS, both conducted in collaboration with Merck. The goal of a cancer vaccine is to
safely expose the patient&#146;s immune system to tumor related antigens, known as neoantigens, to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response. Our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mRNA to express
neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via T cells that recognize those neoantigens, and therefore the tumor. These neoantigens can either be unique to a patient, as in the case of our personalized cancer
vaccine program, or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients, as in the case of our KRAS vaccine program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our cancer vaccines

approximately 600,000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the United States for 2017. Despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors, the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from
checkpoint inhibitors, as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available therapies. In addition, treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms, principally the local immunosuppressive effects of
cancer cells, which prevent either access to or recognition by T cells. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors and
chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific T&nbsp;cells. We believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop
vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient&#146;s T&nbsp;cells that recognize tumor neoantigens. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our approach </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing mRNA-based cancer vaccines to utilize the anti-tumor killing capacity of T cells to drive anti-tumor efficacy. Evidence of tumor killing by T
cells in treating certain cancers has increased in the last decade with advances in immunotherapies. The immune system&#146;s anti-tumor response relies on T cells recognizing tumor cells as non-self and eradicating these &#147;foreign&#148; cells.
Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA, complexes are a diverse set of genes, or alleles, that present fragments of proteins from inside (HLA I) or outside (HLA II) cells to the immune system. A person&#146;s HLA type defines what HLA alleles they express
and can restrict what antigen may be presented to their immune system. Antigens presented in HLA molecules are recognized by T cell receptors, or TCRs, present on the cell surface of CD4 and CD8 T cells. These two main classes of T cells have
distinct mechanisms to potentially attack tumor cells; CD4 cells play an important role in activating other immune cells after recognition of antigens in HLA II molecules, whereas CD8 cells can have direct cytotoxic cell killing capabilities upon
recognition of antigens in HLA I molecules. Both cell types have been demonstrated to have important roles in driving an effective anti-tumor immune response. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past three decades there have been many attempts to develop cancer vaccines, few of which have been
successful. Key reasons include (1)&nbsp;past attempts were directed against shared &#147;self&#148; non-mutated antigens; (2)&nbsp;nearly all previous attempts utilize peptide fragments to try to mimic peptides displayed by HLA I molecules, this
method may not have been able to mimic the natural processing and presentation of antigens by the immune system and therefore may not be recognized; and (3)&nbsp;earlier work was done in the era prior to the benefit of checkpoint inhibitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>We are collaborating with Merck to use the strength of our platform to develop cancer vaccines with multiple neoantigens unique to each patient, also known
as personalized cancer vaccines, or PCVs </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be
achieved by activating antigen specific T&nbsp;cells in a variety of cancer settings. Despite these advances, many patients still have incomplete or no response to anti-cancer therapies. One approach is to administer a cancer vaccine that encodes
for peptides containing mutations found in their cancer, i.e., to create a personalized cancer vaccine composed of neoantigens unique to a patient&#146;s tumor. Previous attempts have demonstrated the ability of mRNA and peptide-based platforms to
drive immune responses toward patient-specific neoantigens. Preclinical studies have shown that the combination of cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors provides improved benefit over single-agent therapies. Our platform is positioned for
bringing personalized cancer vaccines to patients with our proprietary <I>in silico</I> design of each patient&#146;s neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine, to be coupled with our automated cell-free manufacturing processes and infrastructure based in
Norwood, MA, as well as our digital infrastructure. We believe these attributes coupled with our proprietary LNPs help differentiate our approach from ongoing efforts at developing mRNA-based cancer vaccines. mRNA-4157 is co-administered with
pembrolizumab, marketed in the United States as KEYTRUDA. This is in collaboration with Merck as governed by a joint steering committee. NCI-4650 is a personalized cancer vaccine being tested by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, as a
monotherapy for patients with advanced, metastatic cancers. NCI-4650 only differs from mRNA-4157 in its neoantigen selection process. Both mRNA-4157 and NCI-4650 are in Phase 1 trials in the United States. For the mRNA-4157 Phase&nbsp;1 clinical
trial, as of October&nbsp;19, 2018, we have interim immunogenicity data for ten cancer patients. Among these ten patients, we have detected potential antigen specific T&nbsp;cell responses for the first patient with melanoma at the 0.13&nbsp;mg dose
level. This occurred after the fourth dose of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mRNA-4157</FONT> monotherapy. In patients in which negative controls are below the limit of detection, we have detected immunogenicity in three additional patients at
the 0.13 mg dose level after the fourth dose at levels above the lower limit of detection. Because these levels were below the lower limit of quantification of the assay, these data for these three patients are of uncertain significance. We have
observed no signal indicating immunogenicity induced by vaccination in the remaining six patients of which four are at the 0.04 mg dose level and two are at the 0.13 mg dose level. We have triggered planning for a randomized Phase 2 trial with
Merck. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>PCV (mRNA-4157 and NCI-4650): Our product concept </B></P>

patients, many have incomplete or no response to therapy, presenting a need for alternative therapies to stimulate antitumor immunological responses. Finding oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable T cell epitopes has considerable
therapeutic implications. Point mutations in the <I>KRAS</I> gene occur in about 22% of human cancers, such as colorectal, non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancers. Direct inhibition of KRAS has proven challenging and to date, there are no
successful KRAS-targeted cancer therapies. It has been reported that KRAS-mutant neoantigens can be presented on certain human HLAs. Therefore, one approach is to immunize the body to naturally synthesize neoantigen peptides that contain common KRAS
mutations for presentation to the immune system by mRNA. Immune-potentiators are sometimes incorporated in vaccine design to improve immune response to the antigens of interest. STimulator of INterferon Gene, or STING, is a cytosolic nucleotide
sensor known to trigger type&nbsp;1 interferon responses and has been reported to promote antigen specific T cell responses and antitumor immunity. We have designed an mRNA to generate and present KRAS neoantigens to the immune system from the four
most common <I>KRAS</I> mutations. This mRNA has been co-formulated with an mRNA encoding for a constitutively-active version of STING which may boost anti-tumor T cell responses. We are advancing this program through clinical trials in
collaboration with Merck and we have transferred the IND to Merck, since Merck is the sponsor of the Phase&nbsp;1 trial. Merck has opted to run a Phase 1 clinical trial with mRNA encoding for KRAS neoantigens alone first. Merck may choose to include
STING mRNA in further clinical development of this vaccine. Patients will also be co-administered the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>KRAS vaccine

potential therapeutic implications: (1)&nbsp;driver mutations are subject to positive selection, as they confer survival advantages for the tumor, and (2)&nbsp;such neoantigens could be shared between patients, enabling an easier approach to
developing and manufacturing such therapeutic or curative interventions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">KRAS is a frequently mutated oncogene in epithelial cancers, primarily lung,
colorectal cancer, or CRC, and pancreatic cancers. The four most prevalent KRAS mutations associated with these&nbsp;malignancies are G12D, G12V, G13D, and G12C, which constitute 80% to 90% of KRAS mutations. KRAS has multiple downstream signaling
pathways, and although drugs have been developed to target individual effectors, direct inhibition of KRAS could be more efficacious. Direct inhibition of KRAS has proven challenging, as have past efforts at generating a cancer vaccine against KRAS.
These attempts have proven to be ineffective, likely due to either the lack of concomitant administration of a checkpoint inhibitor or vaccines which have been only minimally immunogenic. None of the historic attempts at a KRAS vaccine used mRNA.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immune stimulators are often incorporated in vaccines to improve immune response to the antigens of interest. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane

immune responses to poorly immunogenic antigens. </P>

against tumors. This modality currently has three programs. Our mRNA technology within this modality allows for the combination of multiple therapeutics that can be directly injected into a tumor with the goal of activating the tumor

and approximately 600,000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the United States for 2017. There have been several advances in the treatment of cancer through immune-mediated therapies in recent years. However, the outlook for many patients with
advanced cancer remains poor, especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement and are therefore termed immunologically &#147;cold.&#148; We aim to activate the tumor microenvironment with our mRNA therapeutics, in conjunction with a
checkpoint inhibitor, to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our approach </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our intratumoral immuno-oncology modality is focused on driving robust, specific anti-cancer T cell responses, transforming cold tumors with an
immunosuppressive microenvironment into one that is immunologically &#147;hot&#148; thereby resulting in a productive anti-cancer immune response. Our goal is to discover and develop locally administered, or intratumoral, immune-mediated therapies
to deliver mRNA encoding for potent immune-stimulatory proteins that can act at the site of the injected tumor, reduce systemic toxicities, and potentially create an &#147;abscopal effect&#148; where distal tumor sites are also impacted. These may
be combined with checkpoint inhibitors to boost the response. All of the mRNAs utilized in this modality are designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of microRNA binding sites, thus
potentially reducing off-target effects and resulting in better tolerability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Earlier efforts by others on the utility of intratumoral immune-mediated

be sufficiently cross-reactive in mice, and that the use of human proteins in mice would be expected to elicit anti-foreign protein immune responses. </P>

However, many patients with advanced stages of cancer respond to few therapies and continue to face a poor outlook. Alternative strategies to activate an immunologic <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">anti-tumor</FONT> response, while at the same time
reducing systemic toxicities, are required. To this end, we have developed an investigational mRNA therapeutic coding for wildtype OX40 ligand, or OX40L, protein, a membrane protein normally expressed on antigen presenting cells upon immune
stimulation that augments an activated immune response. mRNA-2416 encodes for wild-type OX40L which is a membrane protein, a class of proteins that we believe cannot be manufactured for administration to tumor cells by recombinant technologies.
mRNA-2416 is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors following local intratumoral injection. We are currently sponsoring a Phase 1 trial that is ongoing in the United States. Of the 26&nbsp;patients dosed with mRNA-2416 through October
2018, the two patients with ovarian cancer have demonstrated clinical observations of regression in certain injected lesions and in an adjacent uninjected lesion. These clinical observations have not met partial response criteria as per the response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors, or RECIST, guidelines version&nbsp;1.1. In one of these patients with ovarian cancer in group&nbsp;2A dosed at 2&nbsp;mg, a reduction in an injected lesion was observed after the fourth dose. In addition, for the
same patient, a reduction in an adjacent uninjected lesion was observed. For the second patient with ovarian cancer in group 1B dosed at 1&nbsp;mg, a reduction in an injected lesion and elevated levels of OX40L protein in the injected lesion have
been observed post dosing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>OX40L (mRNA-2416): Mechanistic overview </B></P>

T cell responses requires T cell receptor, or TCR, engagement by presented epitopes (e.g., cancer antigens) and a positive secondary signal achieved through co-stimulatory molecules like OX40. OX40 receptor (also known as TNFRSF4, or CD134) is a
member of the tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, receptor superfamily and is upregulated on activated immune effector cells upon TCR activation. OX40 is endogenously stimulated via OX40L, a homotrimeric membrane protein normally expressed on
professional antigen presenting cells. Binding of OX40 by OX40L in the presence of a recognized antigen enhances the expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells, increases T cell effector function, and enhances survival of experienced T cells for increased
memory capacity. Prior clinical attempts of activating OX40 with agonist antibodies may have been hampered via antibody interactions with other cells. We believe that introduction of OX40L in tumor sites via mRNA may serve to boost T cell responses,
and we believe intratumoral administration of mRNA encoding for OX40L may be an attractive method of enhancing anti-cancer immunity. </P>

lesions from those patients detected higher OX40L protein levels after mRNA-2416 administration. In approximately 19% of patients, we have observed rapid onset of multiple grade 2 and a single grade 3 transient reversible injection related
reactions, all of which were resolved with antihistamines, corticosteroids, or supplemental oxygen. Three suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, or SUSARs, have been reported. Of the three, one was the grade 3 serious adverse event, or SAE,
described above. A second case was reported for a grade&nbsp;2 non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and the patient was kept overnight at the hospital. In the third case, a patient, diagnosed with Stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma,
experienced a skin ulceration during treatment, deemed to be a non-serious adverse event, located within the injected tumor, which had begun to regress following treatment with mRNA-2416. After the last administered dose of mRNA-2416, and after the
patient withdrew from the trial for personal reasons, the wound was smaller in size. Subsequently, the patient underwent additional treatment for disease progression with Cytoxan/Avastin, the wound increased significantly in size, and Avastin was
discontinued due to patient preference and wound healing concerns. The patient was then hospitalized due to worsening of the skin ulceration, by which time the injected tumor was noted to be absent (though other lesions were present). Although no
longer in the study, this hospitalization was deemed by the investigator as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction related to study drug, but deemed by us as possibly related to study drug. After discharge from the hospital, the patient
died. This death was reported to be due to disease progression, not study drug. After the intratumoral injection of mRNA-2416 in 25 other patients, no other skin ulceration has been observed related to study drug. </P>

cell receptor, or TCR, engagement by presented epitopes (e.g., cancer antigens) and a positive secondary signal achieved through co-stimulatory molecules like OX40. OX40 receptor (also known as TNFRSF4 and CD134) is a member of the tumor necrosis
factor, or TNF, receptor superfamily and is upregulated on activated immune effector cells upon TCR activation. OX40 is endogenously stimulated via OX40L, a homotrimeric membrane protein normally expressed on professional antigen presenting cells.
Binding of OX40 by OX40L in the presence of a recognized antigen enhances the expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells, increases T cell effector function, and enhances survival of experienced T cells for increased memory capacity. Therefore, introduction
of OX40L via mRNA may serve to boost T cell responses. We believe that in addition to boosting T cell responses via OX40L expression, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines within a treated tumor may serve to ignite and transform an
immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into a productive anti-cancer immune response. The initial focus was on cytokines with well-established roles in initiating inflammation and bridging innate to adaptive immunity in humans; namely the IL1
and IL12 families, respectively. Specifically, anti-cancer effects have been observed by introduction of IL1 family member IL36<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#103;</FONT> in preclinical mouse models of cancer. IL12 family members, including IL23,
are often referred to as central coordinators of immune responses, largely due to their capacity to bridge innate to adaptive immunity. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another strategy for cancer patients with immunologically cold tumors is to transform the tumor microenvironment by introducing pro-inflammatory cytokines
directly into tumors or draining lymph nodes. In collaboration with AstraZeneca, we are developing MEDI1191 that is an mRNA for IL12 encapsulated in our proprietary LNP to be delivered intratumorally. Systemic administration of recombinant IL12
protein was poorly tolerated in early clinical trials and exhibited generally low response rates. MEDI1191 can enhance the immune response by positively impacting both antigen presenting cells and T cells, and local, intratumoral expression of IL12
can potentially improve tolerability compared to systemic protein treatments. AstraZeneca is planning a Phase 1 clinical trial for MEDI1191, which is to be co-administered with a checkpoint inhibitor. </P>

The mRNA sequence has been engineered to enhance protein production and is designed to decrease the amount of protein that might be made in hepatocytes for better tolerability. An illustration of our approach for IL12 is shown in the figure below.

States, accounting for one in every four deaths, and is often due to the inability of adult humans to regenerate heart tissue. Current approved therapies do not specifically address heart regeneration. Previous attempts at cardiac regeneration have
included stem cell grafting and gene therapy, but have faced challenges with safety or efficacy. In collaboration with AstraZeneca, we are pioneering a unique approach to treating ischemic heart failure, a condition where the cardiac muscle does not
get enough blood supply to perform its contractile function. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, or VEGF-A, can promote cardiac tissue revascularization. The goal of this program is to promote recovery of cardiac function through partial tissue
regeneration. The mRNA in this program is in a saline formulation without LNPs and is expected to act locally. Our strategic collaborator AstraZeneca has conducted a Phase 1a/b clinical study in diabetic patients in Europe. The study has met its
primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of dose-dependent protein production and changes in blood flow. AstraZeneca has moved this program to a Phase 2a trial that is being conducted in Europe and is

revascularization of the coronary arteries to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac function; and therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate excess fluids in congested tissues, including: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VEGF-A protein acts as a powerful promoter of blood vessel growth. Systemic injection of VEGF-A protein increases VEGF-A exposure throughout the body, which
can lead to side effects, but is very short-lived in circulation. Therefore, any therapy involving VEGF-A needs to be localized to elevate local protein concentration and drive revascularization while minimizing systemic side effects. AstraZeneca
has opted to pursue the localized application of VEGF-A mRNA in a simple saline formulation in the heart muscle to elevate local protein concentration for longer periods due to increased local protein production. This potentially allows for an
extended pharmacodynamic effect at the specific site of injection compared to systemic or local administration of a recombinant protein version of VEGF-A. Some of the early animal work for mRNA VEGF-A was published by our academic co-founder
Dr.&nbsp;Kenneth Chien in <I>Nature Biotechnology </I>in 2013, showing improved cardiac function with increased survival with treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>VEGF-A

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Phase 1a/b study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in men with type 2 diabetes
mellitus. VEGF-A mRNA was administered by intradermal injection into the forearm skin in single ascending doses. The study was conducted in Europe. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product into the
forearm skin, with safety follow-up for 6 months. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The study was divided into Part A (single ascending-dose cohorts) and Part B (pharmacodynamic cohort).
There were three treatment regimens in Part A. Regimens were either AZD8601 at site 1 and placebo at site 2, placebo at site 1 and AZD8601 at site 2, or placebo at both sites. Each regimen comprised six 50 &micro;L injections at one site and six 50
&micro;L injections at a second site on the forearm. In part B, the regimen comprised one 50 &micro;L intradermal injection of either AZD8601 or placebo at each of four sites on the forearm. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There were 27 patients in Part A with 18 receiving AZD8601 in at least one site of the forearm and 9 patients receiving placebo. There were three dose cohorts
in Part A, each with 9 patients. In the first cohort, AZD8601 dose was at 24 &micro;g per patient (4 &micro;g per injection). The AZD8601 dose was increased to 72 &micro;g and 360 &micro;g in the next two dose cohorts. There were 15 patients in Part
B receiving AZD8601 in at least two sites on the forearm per patient. In Part B, each patient received 200 &micro;g of AZD8601 or placebo. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VEGF-A protein
post injection of mRNA was produced at a high level, above the set expected threshold, as shown in the figure below. Expression was measured by skin microdialysis. At each sampling time, mean VEGF-A protein levels across all mRNA treated sites from
patients across all cohorts were higher than that of placebo up to the 24-26 hour time point. Data are means with error bars showing standard error of the mean, or SEM. Asterisk indicates p-value &lt;0.05 </P>

secreted therapeutics modality comprises programs where mRNAs instruct various cells of the human body to secrete proteins for therapeutic effect. For systemic therapeutic programs that utilize cells in the liver, the liver is a highly productive
tissue for secreted protein production. The human liver can make tens of grams of proteins per day, well above the amounts necessary for the pharmacologic effect for virtually all protein therapeutics. We have demonstrated that mRNA can make and
secrete monoclonal antibodies and soluble modulating factors in non-human primates. These proteins made in non-human primates can exert their pharmacological activity by binding to targets with biological effect. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The antibody against Chikungunya virus is our first systemic secreted therapeutic for which we have filed an IND. It will help us understand the fundamental
relationship between mRNA dose and secreted protein production. The secreted human antibody is also a protein complex, not ordinarily made by the liver, which will be a test case for making human proteins in liver normally made by other cell types.

or prophylactic treatments for this disease. This virus can cause severe arthritic-like conditions in approximately 15% of the infected people. This program offers a passive immunization approach using antibodies to prevent infection, to complement
our vaccine approach. In this program, we utilize two mRNAs encoding for light chain and heavy chain of an antibody against the envelope glycoprotein E. We plan to administer these mRNAs encapsulated in our proprietary LNPs intravenously to people
to prevent infection by the Chikungunya virus. We are being financially supported for specific activities by DARPA and have an open IND for mRNA-1944. </P>

virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus posing a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. While Chikungunya has been present in Africa for centuries, recent outbreaks and epidemics in new regions have arisen due to the
expanding distribution of the <I>Aedes</I> mosquito in which it resides. A Chikungunya epidemic beginning in 2004 in Kenya spread to India and was exported to nearly all regions of the world and brought Chikungunya to the attention of the western
world. As of April 2016, Chikungunya cases had been reported in 103&nbsp;countries and territories around the world, including 46 countries and territories throughout the Americas. Chikungunya virus infection is characterized by an acute onset of
fever, rash, myalgia, and sometimes debilitating polyarthralgia, giving the virus its name, which means &#147;that which bends up&#148; when translated from Makonde. It is rarely fatal, but neurological sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and
chronic arthritis have been recognized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family with a positive-strand RNA genome. The viral
structural proteins are naturally expressed as a single polyprotein followed by subsequent cleavage by viral and cellular proteases into capsid (C)&nbsp;and envelope (E)&nbsp;glycoproteins E3, E2, 6k, and E1. The E proteins are major targets of
protective neutralizing antibody responses that can be tested for in assays. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are currently no effective therapies or approved vaccines to treat or
prevent Chikungunya infection or disease, and effective mosquito control has proven challenging, even in higher income countries. Currently, infected individuals are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve some symptoms.
Therefore, in addition to an effective prophylactic vaccine, we believe there is a need for systemic secreted antibody for passive immunity to the Chikungunya virus. </P>

patients are not met. Relaxin is a well-studied natural protein hormone that is known to have cardiovascular protective effects. Earlier attempts at developing relaxin as a protein therapeutic have failed. Novartis has been developing a recombinant
relaxin protein therapeutic with a short 30 minute half-life called serelaxin in a Phase 3 trial, which recently failed to meet its primary endpoints. We believe patient selection and duration of action of the protein therapeutic played a role in
its failure, and that engineering the Relaxin protein for a longer duration and repeat dosing might overcome the shortcomings of earlier attempts. In collaboration with AstraZeneca, we use mRNA encoding for a relaxin protein designed for a long
duration of action. It is also designed to be produced by the body with human post-translational modifications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Relaxin (AZD7970): Disease overview

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump blood efficiently and presents itself as either an impairment of ejection of the blood (systolic heart
failure) or defective ventricular filling (diastolic heart failure). It is associated with fluid retention in peripheral tissues, including the lungs, leading to tissue congestion, dyspnea, fatigue, and ultimately death. heart failure is a major
unmet medical need, as the leading worldwide cause of hospitalization in the elderly with 1.1&nbsp;million cases annually in the United States. Its incidence is increasing with an aging population and improved survival rates from myocardial infarcts

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fabry disease is an X-linked hereditary defect in glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by mutations in the <I>GLA</I> gene, which encodes for the lysosomal
protein alpha galactosidase, or <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-GAL. It is one of a number of lysosomal storage diseases. Decreased activity of <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-GAL results in the lysosomal accumulation
of substrates (Gb3 and Lyso-Gb3) within cells and tissues, ultimately impairing cell/tissue function. Currently, there are several approved therapies for the treatment of Fabry disease including enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, and chaperone
therapy. However, patients continue to suffer from renal decline with ERTs and limited patient eligibility for chaperone therapy, as well as immunogenic side effects of ERTs. With our platform technology, the cells in the human body can be
instructed to produce <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-GAL from the liver and other tissues to properly insert <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-GAL into lysosomes. Additionally, these tissues can secrete it into
circulation for delivery to other tissues. We are developing an intravenously administered mRNA that encodes <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-GAL enzyme and we plan to conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of mRNA-3630 in Fabry patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Fabry disease (mRNA-3630): Disease overview </B></P>

disease is a progressive, multiorgan, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with an annual incidence of approximately 1:80,000. Affected individuals have a deficiency in <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-GAL, resulting in a reduced or
complete inability to metabolize glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes. Thus, patients accumulate glycosphingolipids such as Gb3 within lysosomes, which ultimately results in cellular and tissue dysfunction. In Fabry patients, multiple organs are
impacted including the kidney and heart; and the vasculature gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. The severity of the disease is related to the lack of enzyme activity in patient cells. Classic Fabry patients are the most affected
individuals, and generally retain &lt;1% of normal enzyme activity. Diagnosis of Fabry disease occurs generally during childhood, but in some patients it is diagnosed later in life, usually after the patient presents with a stroke or renal
complications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, there are several approved therapies for the treatment of Fabry disease. Agalsidase beta, which is marketed as Fabrazyme by

slowing disease progression, however patients that have been on ERTs for 10 years still have renal function decline at a rate greater than normal healthy individuals. In addition to ERTs, Amicus Therapeutics has approval in the United States and
European market for migalastat, a small molecule chaperone therapy which treats a subset of patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Fabry disease (mRNA-3630): Our product concept

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MMA associated with MUT deficiency is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. There are approximately 500-2,000
MMA MUT deficiency patients in the United States based on estimated birth prevalence (0.3-1.2:100,000 newborns) and mortality rates. Mortality is significant, with reported mortality rates of 50% for MMA patients with complete MUT deficiency (mut<SUP

study. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MMA mainly affects the pediatric population and usually presents in the first few days or weeks of life. The occurrence of acute metabolic
decompensations is the hallmark of the disorder and decompensations are typically more frequent in the first few years of life. Each decompensation is life-threatening and often requires hospitalization and management at an intensive care unit.
Surviving patients often suffer from numerous complications including chronic renal failure and neurologic complications such as movement disorders, developmental delays, and seizures. Consequently, the health-related quality of life for MMA
patients and their families is significantly impaired. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The disorder is autosomal recessive and primarily caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene
encoding MUT, a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes certain proteins and fats, resulting in complete (mut<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">0</SUP>) or partial (mut<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">-</SUP>) enzyme
deficiency. Over 250 mutations have been reported to date for MUT, with many MMA patients carrying private mutations. The most frequent mutations include p.N219Y and p.R369H, occurring with allelic frequencies of 8% in a large European cohort
(n=151). Population-specific mutations have been reported, such as the p.R108C and p.G717V mutations identified in Hispanic and African-American patients, respectively. Due to a deficiency in the MUT enzyme resulting in a blockage in a metabolic
pathway, the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as methylmalonic acid in all body fluids and tissues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for MMA as of today. Carglumic acid (marketed as Carbaglu) is approved in the EU for the
acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including MMA but does not address the underlying defect. Liver transplant and combined liver-kidney transplant have emerged as effective treatment options for severely affected
individuals, resulting in substantial reductions in metabolic decompensations and circulating methylmalonic acid concentrations. However, liver or kidney transplant is not curative, and the risks associated with the procedure and the limited number
of donors prohibit the widespread implementation of transplantation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Methylmalonic acidemia (mRNA-3704): Our product concept </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Propionic acidemia, or PA, is a rare, life-threatening, inherited metabolic disorder due to a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase, or
PCC. It primarily affects the pediatric population. There is no approved therapy for PA, including no approved enzyme replacement therapy, due to the complexity of the enzyme, which comprises six copies each of two different subunits (PCCA and
PCCB), and its mitochondrial localization. The only effective treatment for severely affected individuals is liver transplant, aimed at increasing enzyme activity to reduce the occurrence of life-threatening acute metabolic crises. Our platform is
uniquely positioned to potentially address this disease by enabling synthesis of this complex enzyme that is localized in the mitochondria of the cell. We are developing an IV-administered mRNA therapeutic comprising two different mRNAs encoding
PCCA and PCCB in our proprietary LNP to replace the defective PCC enzyme with functional enzyme in liver and other cells. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PA patients. </P>

is an inherited metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality and no approved therapy </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PA is a serious inborn error of metabolism
disorder, closely related to MMA, with significant morbidity and mortality. There are approximately 325-2,000 PA patients in the United States based on estimated birth prevalence (0.2-1.2:100,000 newborns) and mortality rates. The vast majority of
patients present with life-threatening metabolic crises during the first days or weeks of life, with mortality rates ranging from 13-53% during the neonatal period. Similar to MMA, the cardinal feature of the disorder is the occurrence of
life-threatening acute metabolic decompensations that are more frequent in the first few years of life. Longer term sequelae include cardiac complications (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias) and severe neurologic complications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The disorder is caused by a defect or deficiency in PCC, an enzyme that is one step upstream in the same metabolic pathway as the MUT enzyme that is deficient
in MMA. PCC is a complex hetero-dodecamer enzyme composed of six alpha subunits (PCCA) and six beta subunits (PCCB). The disorder is autosomal recessive, with PA patients generally having loss-of-function mutations in either PCCA or PCCB (and in
rare instances, mutations in both PCCA and PCCB). To date, over 100 mutations have been identified for both PCCA and PCCB genes and, similar to MMA, most of the mutations are private. Also similar to MMA, due to this enzyme deficiency resulting in a
metabolic block, the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid and 2-methylcitrate, among others, and these metabolites may be used as biomarkers of disease. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is no approved therapy for PA to treat the underlying defect, including no enzyme replacement therapy, due to the complexity of PCC and mitochondrial
localization. Carglumic acid (marketed as Carbaglu) is approved in the EU for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias, including PA, but does not address the underlying defect. Management of the disorder is otherwise
limited to strict dietary restrictions and other supportive measures similar to MMA. Liver transplant is a radical yet effective treatment, with the aim of increasing PCC enzyme activity in liver for severely affected individuals. However,
transplant as a therapeutic option has significant limitations, including the risks of the procedure itself. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Propionic acidemia (mRNA-3927): Our

the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, or PAH. The most effective treatment is a restrictive diet of low protein, which controls PHE intake. Approximately 20-56% of PKU patients respond to sapropterin dihydrochloride (marketed as Kuvan in the United
States), a synthetic BH4 cofactor for PAH which improves PHE metabolism, but does not fully cure patients. In addition, Biomarin has received approval for pegylated phenylalanine lyase, or PAL, marketed as Palynziq. Palynziq is a pegylated
recombinant bacterial enzyme which metabolizes PHE in the blood. Severe anaphylaxis is associated with Palynziq and patients are provided epinephrine to self-administer in the event of a serious allergic reaction. We believe the immune risk is, at
least in part, driven by bacterial PAL. With our mRNA technology, cells in the human body can be instructed to produce functional PAH, decreasing PHE levels in the blood and restoring production of tyrosine. We are developing an intravenously

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Phenylketonuria (mRNA-3283): Disease overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>There
are options to treat PKU which are not widely applicable, and efforts by other companies are likely to face hurdles </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PKU occurs in approximately
1:10,000-15,000 live births in the United States<I>.</I> Based on current population estimates that would translate into approximately 21,000-32,000 PKU patients in the United States. Affected individuals have a deficiency in the enzyme PAH,
resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. Thus, PKU patients suffer from a phenylalanine intoxication and a subsequent deprivation of tyrosine, leading to severe mental
disability if left untreated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PAH is expressed as a monomer, but functions as a tetramer and requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor to complete
the conversion of PHE to tyrosine, thereby maintaining adequate PHE:TYR ratios within circulation. To date, greater than 950 gene variants have been identified in the PAH gene, resulting in PKU. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Diagnosis of PKU occurs primarily through newborn screening in available countries, followed by genetic confirmation. Newly diagnosed patients receive medical
formulas containing protein with low PHE content to control blood PHE and provide adequate nutrition for growing infants. As patients age they are tested for sensitivity to synthetic BH4 and may transition to Kuvan. Approximately 20% of patients
respond favorably to Kuvan, which can aid in PHE control. Nonresponsive patients are treated mainly with restricted diet; however, adherence to the diet is challenging, resulting in poor compliance. When PHE levels are not adequately controlled,
patients begin to show multiple signs of disease, including depression, anxiety, poor executive function, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2018, Biomarin received approval to market Palynziq. However, treatment with Palynziq has resulted in a number of hypersensitivity reactions as well as
the formation of anti-drug antibodies in PKU patients. In addition to tolerability concerns associated with Palynziq administration, this bacterial enzyme does not convert PHE to tyrosine and may not restore optimal PHE to TYR ratios in patients.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One option for PKU patients may be treatment with gene therapy. We believe there are potential advantages for mRNA therapeutics for this disorder over
gene therapy as described in the systemic intracellular therapeutics modality section. </P>

equipment enable us to produce multiple high quality mRNA and formulated constructs within a limited timeframe from order to delivery. We currently have infrastructure capable of producing up to
1,000&nbsp;lots of mRNA sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks from sequence to final product. The typical scale of mRNA manufactured by this team is 1-10 mg. We have produced more than 18,000 lots of research

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Analogous to the Research Engine, we have proactively established manufacturing capabilities for the Early Development Engine. We started supplying product to
enable IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies, and for human clinical studies, meeting required cGMP standards, with a combination of internal manufacturing at our Cambridge headquarters and external manufacturing at well-established contract
manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. Most recently, we invested in Norwood, which opened in July 2018 and has extensive capability and capacity to produce research and clinical supply for our programs as well as to enable technology development and
scale-up for future needs. We will continue to selectively use CMOs to complement our internal capacity to provide supply contingency and expanded capability where needed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This extensive capacity has helped enable our broad pipeline of 21 development candidates, including the significant output necessary to supply our
toxicological and human clinical studies. Though the underpinnings of the technology utilized across these 21 programs are the same, each program typically requires customization driven in part by its target product profile. These custom features
range from varying molecular architecture to different routes of administration, and often necessitate multivalent products. For example, our CMV vaccine (mRNA-1647) requires six different mRNA sequences to be manufactured for inclusion in an
intramuscular mRNA medicine, whereas OX40L (mRNA-2416) requires a single mRNA sequence for inclusion in an intratumoral mRNA medicine. All programs, with the exception of PCV, require that we scale up supply over time to meet the clinical demand
required in the different phases of development and prepare the process for regulatory approval and eventually commercial supply, where bigger batch sizes will be required. In contrast, the PCV program is designed to provide each patient with a
cancer vaccine that is designed and manufactured for that specific patient, thus increasing the number of batches to match the number of patients treated. As we scale the manufacturing output for particular programs, we plan to continuously improve
yield, purity, and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates from IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies through commercial launch, including improvement to shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug
substance. Typically after a change in process, more time may be required for pharmaceutical property testing, such as 6- or 12-month stability testing. This time lag may necessitate resupplying clinical materials, or making additional cGMP batches
to meet clinical trial demand, before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Supply of mRNA and formulated product for
toxicology studies:</B> Early on, we established the internal capability to produce mRNA and formulated product for IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies for our development candidates under GLP standards. To date, we have produced more than 50
batches of mRNA to support these studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Supply of cGMP mRNA and formulated product for human clinical studies: </B>We have
incrementally built the capability to produce and supply mRNA drug product for clinical development. In our early years, we outsourced cGMP supply. We selected specialized CMOs to support a total of five programs by the end of 2015. In 2016, we

we digitally integrate patient-specific data from sequencing tumor samples and automatically design PCVs for patients. We have developed proprietary bioinformatics design algorithms, and have
linked them to an automated manufacturing process for rapid production of formulated mRNA that can be turned around in a matter of weeks. The PCV manufacturing capability is termed Personalized Vaccine Unit, or PVU. PCV manufacturing is conducted
using custom automated and engineering solutions utilizing single-use systems with fast &#147;needle-to-needle&#148; turnaround time. We have operationalized PCV manufacture within our external CMO network to meet our Phase 1 supply needs, while in
parallel working to internalize manufacturing. Unlike traditional process development, where the product is scaled up in quantity for later phases of development and commercialization, each PCV is manufactured for a single patient and thus
scaled-out with extensive use of automation and robotics for the larger numbers of patients involved in later phases of development and commercialization. </P>

seek to ensure quality at Moderna through a combination of a robust Quality Management System, or QMS, our quality culture, and through our people. In accordance with applicable regulations we have established, documented, and implemented a QMS to

interaction of these processes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary mode of documenting these key practices is through policies, standard operating procedures, forms, and other
quality records, which include an overarching Quality Policy and Quality Manual. We have implemented measurement tools and metrics to monitor, measure, and analyze these practices to support cGMP operations, achieve planned results, and support
continuous improvement. We monitor these quality metrics through formal governance processes, including Quality Management Review, or QMR, and our Quality Council to enable continuous improvement. We have also established an independent Quality Unit
that fulfills quality assurance and quality control responsibilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the Quality Unit is ultimately accountable and responsible for quality,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2013, we entered into an Option Agreement and a related Services and Collaboration Agreement with AstraZeneca, which were amended and restated in June
2018. We refer to these amended and restated agreements as the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements. Under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements, we granted AstraZeneca certain exclusive rights and licenses to research, develop and commercialize potential therapeutic mRNA
medicines directed at certain targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, and agreed to provide related services to AstraZeneca. The activities to be performed by the parties under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements
are limited to defined biological targets in the cardiovascular and cardiometabolic fields and one defined target in the cancer field. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the
2018 A&amp;R Agreements, AstraZeneca is responsible for all research, development and commercialization activities and associated costs, while we provide specified research and manufacturing services, at AstraZeneca&#146;s expense, during a research
and evaluation period, as described below, to further AstraZeneca&#146;s activities conducted pursuant to an agreed upon services plan. AstraZeneca may request we provide additional services, at AstraZeneca&#146;s expense. Subject to customary
&#147;back-up&#148; supply rights granted to AstraZeneca, we exclusively manufacture (or have manufactured) mRNA for all research, development and commercialization purposes under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements until, on a product-by-product basis, the
expiration of the time period for which we are entitled to receive earn-out payments with respect to such product pursuant to the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements. </P>

Agreements, AstraZeneca acquired forty options that it may exercise to obtain exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize identified development candidates (and related back-up candidates) directed to specified targets that arise during
the research and evaluation period. During the research and evaluation period for research candidates, AstraZeneca may elect to designate a limited number of research candidates as development candidates in order to continue preclinical development
on such development candidates (and related back-up candidates). From such pool of development candidates designated by AstraZeneca, during a specified option exercise period, AstraZeneca may then exercise one of its options to obtain exclusive
rights to clinically develop and commercialize an identified development candidate (and related back-up candidates) in certain fields. If AstraZeneca does not exercise one of its options to acquire exclusive rights to clinically develop and
commercialize a particular development candidate during the defined option exercise period for such development candidate, AstraZeneca&#146;s rights to exercise an option and other rights granted under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements with respect to
such development candidate (and related back-up candidates) will terminate, all rights to exploit such development candidate (and related back-up candidates) will be returned to us and all data and results generated by AstraZeneca with respect to
such development candidate (and related back-up candidates) will be either assigned or licensed to us. Upon the earlier of termination of the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements for any reason and a specified anniversary of the effective date of the original
Option Agreement and Services and Collaboration Agreement in 2013, all unexercised options, and the right to exercise any and all options if not previously exercised by AstraZeneca, will automatically terminate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On a target-by-target basis, we and AstraZeneca have agreed to certain defined exclusivity obligations under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements with respect to the
research, development and commercialization of mRNA medicines for such target in certain fields. In addition, we and AstraZeneca have agreed to certain defined exclusivity obligations with respect to the research, development and commercialization

Cellscript-MRT Agreements and aggregate sublicense grant fees of $25&nbsp;million in early 2018. We are required to pay Cellscript and MRT additional aggregate sublicense grant fees of $22 million in early 2019. Cellscript and MRT are collectively
eligible to receive, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, milestone payments totaling up to $0.5&nbsp;million upon the achievement of certain regulatory-based events for diagnostic products, and milestone payments totaling up to
$1.5&nbsp;million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory-based events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products, and up to $24&nbsp;million upon the achievement of certain commercial-based events for either therapeutic or
prophylactic products. The Cellscript-MRT Agreements require us to pay royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products at rates in the low single digits for therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic uses, and royalties based on annual net
sales of licensed products sold for research uses at rates in the mid-single digits, subject to certain reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor. Following the first commercial sale of licensed products under a Cellscript-MRT Agreement, we are
required to pay Cellscript or MRT, as applicable, minimum annual royalties ranging from $10,000&#151;$400,000 depending on the use of such licensed product, with all such payments creditable against earned royalties on net sales. </P>

Cellscript or MRT, as applicable, may terminate its respective Cellscript-MRT Agreement if we fail to make required payments or otherwise materially breach the applicable agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions. Cellscript or MRT,
as applicable, may also terminate the applicable Cellscript-MRT Agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the Penn Modified mRNA Patents. We have the right to
terminate each Cellscript-MRT Agreement at will upon 60 days&#146; prior notice to Cellscript or MRT, as applicable, provided that we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products upon such termination. If rights to MRT or
Cellscript under the Penn Modified mRNA Patents are terminated (e.g., due to bankruptcy of MRT or Cellscript), the terminated party will assign its interest in the respective Cellscript-MRT Agreement to the licensor from which it received rights
under the Penn Modified mRNA Patents and our rights will continue under the new licensor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Formulation technology in-licenses </I></B></P>

animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for
safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to
the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after
the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In
such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. </P>

involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control, in accordance with GCP
requirements, which include the requirement that all patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical
trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the
IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also
are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes
for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving National
Institutes of Health, or NIH, funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation are submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Science Policy, or OSP,
pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving
recombinant DNA; however, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Pursuant to the NIH Guidelines, research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules must be approved
by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to
public health or the environment. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical
considerations, at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OSP will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC </P>

to amend the NIH Guidelines to streamline oversight for human gene transfer clinical research protocols and reduce duplicative reporting requirements while focusing the NIH Guidelines more specifically on biosafety issues associated with research
involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. The notice included proposed amendments to eliminate RAC review and reporting requirements to NIH for human gene transfer research protocols and to modify the roles and responsibilities of
investigators, institutions, IBCs, the RAC, and the NIH to be consistent with these goals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of

Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,&#148; which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development, i.e., the first-in-human
clinical trial, to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA.

referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to

case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor&#146;s initial receipt of the information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and other types of clinical
trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an
unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been
associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This
group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop
additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must
be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be
selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. </P>

trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA or NDA, along
with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. A BLA is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the
biologic&#146;s safety, purity, and potency. An NDA for a new drug must contain proof of the drug&#146;s safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as
well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product&#146;s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support
marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before a biologic or
drug may be marketed in the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a user
fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees
are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA reviews all
submitted BLAs and NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA or NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA or NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such
decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA or NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the
filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA or NDA for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA or NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not
always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing
facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate
to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with
GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review,
evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on
approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a
Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic or drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is
complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional
clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may
either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA or NDA
does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. </P>

FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000
individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic
agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the
product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as
a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive
approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication; in the latter case, because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor&#146;s product
could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same drug and same indication,
as defined by the FDA, for which we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader
than the orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union, or EU, has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria.
Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the
condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA or NDA approval,
but ideally no later than the pre-BLA or pre-NDA meeting. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as
priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available
therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage
over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or
IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled
post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe
use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or
more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically
significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or
the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the
development or approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Pediatric information </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or NDA or supplement to a BLA or NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the
claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full
or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric
Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or

product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising
requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as &#145;&#145;off-label use&#146;&#146;), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although
physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use.
Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or NDA or BLA or NDA
supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may also place other conditions on
approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not
approve the BLA or NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk
minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards, or
if problems occur following initial marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance
with cGMP regulations. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of certain clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations.
We, and these manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from
cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced
inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP
compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product,
manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including recall. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines, some of our U.S.
patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent
term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the
product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA or NDA and the approval
of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides three years
of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the
application, for example for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not
prohibit the FDA from approving abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. The FDCA also provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within
the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or
ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether
the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be
submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. Three-year and five-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval
of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the
reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through
analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the
reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety

the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the
biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule,

before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the
current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. </P>

simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is
selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which
are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or

generic or biosimilar marketing application can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of

the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate
sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is
granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of
market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in
significant ways and often are not <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-empted</FONT> by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. </P></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light
of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations,
prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving
applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil,
criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight, and reporting obligations if
we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</FONT> with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the
physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties, and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply
with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">time-</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">resource-consuming</FONT> and can divert a
company&#146;s attention from the business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Current and future healthcare reform legislation </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare
system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines, restrict or regulate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">post-approval</FONT> activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any investigational medicines
for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that
we, or any strategic collaborators, may receive for any approved products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject biological products to
potential competition by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lower-cost</FONT> biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid
managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part&nbsp;D beneficiaries and, annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs. With the current presidential administration and
Congress, there may be additional administrative or legislative changes, including modification, repeal, or replacement of all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which may impact reimbursement for drugs and biologics. On January&nbsp;20, 2017, an
Executive Order was signed directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden
on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October&nbsp;13, 2017, an Executive Order was signed terminating the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cost-sharing</FONT>
subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on
October&nbsp;25, 2017. In addition, the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group
marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills this year designed to repeal or repeal
and replace portions of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing, effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-based</FONT> shared responsibility payment
imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain </P>

containment programs, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">price-controls,</FONT> restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health
care costs. For example, the federal government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. Individual
states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints,
discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation, from other countries and bulk purchasing. </P>

have been elected and qualified or until the earlier of their resignation or removal. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective upon the closing of this offering and amended and restated bylaws that will become
effective upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, also provide that our directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the votes that all our

each <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director. In considering the independence of the directors listed above, our board of directors considered the association of our directors with the holders of more than 5% of our common
stock. Upon the completion of this offering, we expect that the composition and functioning of our board of directors and each of our committees will comply with all applicable requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the rules and
regulations of the SEC. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. Mr.&nbsp;Bancel is not an independent director under these rules because he is an executive officer of the Company. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, the role of chairman of the board of directors is separated from the role of Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for
recommending strategic decisions and capital allocation to the board of directors and to ensure the execution of the recommended plans. The chairman of the board of directors is responsible for leading the board of directors in its fundamental role
of providing advice to and independent oversight of management. Our board of directors recognizes the time, effort, and energy that the Chief Executive Officer is required to devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as the
commitment required to serve as our chairman, particularly as the board of directors&#146; oversight responsibilities continue to grow. While our amended and restated <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">by-laws</FONT> and corporate governance
guidelines will not require that our chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our board of directors believes that having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our
commitment to good corporate governance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success.
We face a number of risks, including the four risks more fully discussed in the section entitled &#147;Business&#148; appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Management is responsible for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT> management of risks we face, while our board of directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our board of
directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The role of the board of directors in overseeing the management of our risks is conducted primarily through committees of the board of directors, as disclosed
in the descriptions of each of the committees below and in the charters of each of the committees. The full board of directors (or the appropriate board committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) discusses
with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on us, and the steps we take to manage them. When a board committee is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the management of a particular risk or risks, the chairman of the
relevant committee reports on the discussion to the full board of directors during the committee reports portion of the next board meeting. This enables the board of directors and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly
with respect to risk interrelationships. </P>

Company and individual performance objectives. For the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, the target annual bonuses for Mr.&nbsp;Bancel, Dr.&nbsp;Hoge and Dr.&nbsp;Kim were equal to 60%, 50% and 50%, respectively, of the applicable named
executive officer&#146;s annual base salary; however, each named executive officer earned more than his target annual bonus for such fiscal year, based on his individual performance during such fiscal year. The amounts earned under this program with
respect to the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 are reported under the &#147;Bonus&#148; column in the Summary Compensation Table above. </P>

entered into an offer letter with Mr.&nbsp;Bancel, who currently serves as our Chief Executive Officer. The offer letter set forth Mr.&nbsp;Bancel&#146;s initial annual base salary, initial target annual bonus and initial equity award grants.
Mr.&nbsp;Bancel is subject to our standard <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-competition,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-solicitation,</FONT> confidentiality, and assignment agreement, which provides for a perpetual post-termination
confidentiality covenant as well as post-termination <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-competition</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-solicitation</FONT> of customers, employees and consultants covenants for one year following

the letter agreement, as amended, the Company has agreed to grant Mr. Bancel an option to purchase 10,000,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock (subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock consolidation or similar event prior
to grant), contingent on, and effective immediately following, the time the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is declared effective by the SEC, or the IPO Effective Date, subject to Mr.&nbsp;Bancel&#146;s continuous
employment with the Company through such date and the IPO Effective Date occurring no later than December&nbsp;31, 2019. If our initial public offering does not close within five business days after the IPO Effective Date, then the option grant will
be forfeited at such time. The option will have a per share exercise price equal to the &#147;Price to the Public&#148; (or equivalent) set forth on the cover page of the final prospectus included in the registration statement, which will be the
fair market value of a share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the grant date of the option. The &#147;Vesting Commencement Date&#148; for the option is June&nbsp;13, 2018. The option will be divided into two tranches. <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">One-half</FONT> of the shares subject to the option, or the Tranche&nbsp;1 Portion, will vest on the fifth anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date, generally subject to Mr.&nbsp;Bancel&#146;s continued employment with
the Company through such date, and the remaining <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of the shares subject to the option, or the Tranche&nbsp;2 Portion, will vest in accordance with the following schedule: 25% of the shares subject to
the Tranche&nbsp;2 Portion will vest on the second anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date and the remaining shares subject to the Tranche&nbsp;2 Portion will vest in equal quarterly installments thereafter for the next three years, generally
subject to Mr.&nbsp;Bancel&#146;s continued employment with the Company through each applicable vesting date. The option will be subject to the terms, conditions, definitions and provisions of the 2018 Stock Plan, and the applicable stock option
agreement thereunder. Our board of directors has elected to make this option grant to recognize Mr.&nbsp;Bancel&#146;s continuing leadership of the Company in its mission to create a new category of transformative medicines based on mRNA. The board
of directors believes that setting the exercise price for this option grant at the price of the shares sold to the public in our initial public offering will further align on a going-forward basis the economic interests of our Chief Executive
Officer and our stockholders, including those purchasing shares in our initial public offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stephen Hoge </I></P>

replace our 2016 Plan, as our board of directors has determined not to make additional awards under the 2016 Plan following the closing of this offering. The 2018 Stock Plan will provide flexibility to our compensation committee to use various

will provide that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the plan will automatically increase each January&nbsp;1, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2019, by 4% of the outstanding number of shares of our common stock on the

outstanding under the 2016 Plan and 11,125,718&nbsp;shares remained available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan. Following this offering, we will not grant any further awards under our 2016 Plan, but all outstanding awards under the 2016 Plan

that are withheld upon exercise of a stock option or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, are currently added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Following this offering,

more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, or a 10% owner, the exercise price per share of our common stock underlying each such stock option must have been at least equal to 110% of the fair market value of a share of
our common stock on the date of grant. The term of each stock option may not have exceeded 10 years from the date of grant (or five years for a 10% owner). The exercise price of a stock option (i) may be made in cash, (ii) if an initial public
offering of the Company has occurred, may be made through a broker-assisted arrangement, (iii) if permitted by the board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors (the &#147;Committee&#148;) and an initial public offering of
the company has occurred, may be made through the delivery of shares of our common stock owned by the participant or, (iv) if permitted by the Committee, may be made through a net exercise arrangement for non-qualified stock options. After a
participant&#146;s termination of service (other than a termination for cause), the participant generally may exercise his or her stock options, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, for three months after termination or such longer
period of time as specified in the applicable stock option agreement; provided, that if the termination is due to death or disability, the stock option generally will remain exercisable, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, until the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2016 Plan permits the granting of shares of unrestricted stock. Unrestricted stock awards may be granted to participants in recognition of past services

stock units. A restricted stock unit is an award that covers a number of shares of our common stock that may be settled upon vesting in cash or by the issuance of the underlying shares. The administrator determines the terms and conditions of
restricted stock units, including the number of units granted, the vesting criteria (which may include accomplishing specified performance criteria or continued service to us), and the form and timing of payment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2016 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer or assignment of awards, other than, at the discretion of the plan administrator, by will or the laws
of descent and distribution, pursuant to a domestic relations order, by gift to an immediate family member, or by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust in which the award is passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the participant.

awards of a successor entity, or otherwise continued or terminated at the effective time of such sale event. In the event that outstanding equity awards will be terminated, such equity awards will become fully vested as of the consummation of the
sale event. In the case of the termination of outstanding stock options, such stock options may be exercised to the extent then exercisable within a period of time prior to the consummation of the sale event. In the case of forfeiture of restricted
stock, such awards may be repurchased by us for a price per share equal to the original per share purchase price paid by the participant for the shares. We may also make or provide for a cash payment to holders of vested and exercisable stock
options, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, equal to, for each share of our common stock underlying such stock option, the difference between the per share cash consideration in the sale event and the per share exercise price. We may make or
provide for a cash payment to holders of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, in an amount equal to the product of the per share cash consideration in the sale event and the number of shares
subject to each such award. </P>

SEC. The ESPP initially reserves and authorizes the issuance of up to a total of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares of common stock to participating employees. The ESPP provides that the number of
shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January&nbsp;1, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2020, by the least of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares of our common stock,
1% of the outstanding number of shares of our common stock on the immediately preceding December&nbsp;31, or such lesser number of shares as determined by our compensation committee. This number will be subject to adjustment in the event of a stock

have completed at least 30&nbsp;days of employment will be eligible to participate in the ESPP. Any employee who owns 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock will not be eligible to purchase shares under the

Offerings will usually begin every six months and will continue for six-month periods, referred to as offering periods. Each eligible employee may elect to participate in any offering by submitting an enrollment form at least 15&nbsp;business days
before the relevant offering date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each employee who is a participant in the ESPP may purchase shares by authorizing contributions of between 1% and 50%
of his or her compensation during an offering period. Unless the participating employee has previously withdrawn from the offering, his or her accumulated contributions will be used to purchase shares on the last business day of the purchase period
at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the first business day of the offering period or the last business day of the purchase period, whichever is lower, provided that no more than
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of common stock (or a lesser number as established by the plan administrator in advance of the purchase period) may be purchased by any one employee during each purchase
period. Under applicable tax rules, an employee may purchase no more than $25,000 worth of shares of common stock, valued at the start of the offering period, under the ESPP for each calendar year in which a purchase right is outstanding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accumulated contributions of any employee who is not a participant on the last day of a purchase period will be refunded. An employee&#146;s rights under
the ESPP terminate upon voluntary withdrawal from the plan or when the employee ceases employment with us for any reason. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ESPP may be terminated or
amended by our board of directors at any time, but will automatically terminate on the 10-year anniversary of this offering. An amendment that increases the number of shares of common stock that are authorized under the ESPP and certain other
amendments will require the approval of our stockholders. The plan administrator may adopt subplans under the ESPP for employees of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. </P>

published or such other appropriate time as the compensation committee determines. If the corporate performance goals and individual performance objectives are met, payments will be made as soon as practicable following the end of each performance
period, but not later than 74 days after the end of the fiscal year in which such performance period ends. Subject to the rights contained in any agreement between the executive officer and us, an executive officer must be employed by us on the
bonus payment date to be eligible to receive a bonus payment. The Bonus Plan also permits the compensation committee to approve additional bonuses to executive officers in its sole discretion. </P>

in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, our board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without
stockholder approval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder group. In this regard, our certificate of incorporation grants
our board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to
holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of these holders and may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us. </P>

proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock paid to a foreign entity unless (i)&nbsp;if the foreign entity is a &#147;foreign financial institution,&#148; such foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence, reporting,

exempt under FATCA. Under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, withholding under FATCA currently applies to payments of dividends on our common stock, but will only apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common
stock made after December&nbsp;31, 2018. Under certain circumstances, a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> holder may be eligible for refunds or credits of this withholding tax. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States
and an applicable foreign country may modify the requirements described in this paragraph. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-U.S.</FONT> holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their

common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting
agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under their option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters can close out a
covered short sale by exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open
market price of shares compared to the price available under their option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may also sell shares in excess of their option to purchase additional shares, creating a naked short position. The underwriters
must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open
market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of common stock in the open market to stabilize the
price of the common stock. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the common stock above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the common stock. The underwriters are not required to
engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular

assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/ Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP </P>

Inc. is a Delaware Corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July&nbsp;22, 2016 (collectively, with its consolidated subsidiaries, any of Moderna, Company, we, us or our). In August 2018, we changed our name from Moderna
Therapeutics, Inc. to Moderna, Inc. We are the successor in interest to Moderna LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2013. Our principal executive office is located at 200 Technology Square,
Cambridge,&nbsp;MA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are creating a new category of transformative medicines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), to improve the lives of patients. Since
inception, we have incurred significant operating losses, which were $216.2 million, $255.9 million, $218.0 million (unaudited) and $243.3 million (unaudited) for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 and for the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $621.9 million and $865.2 million (unaudited), respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant
expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. In addition, we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities to support our platform research, drug discovery and clinical development,
infrastructure and Research Engine and Early Development engine, digital infrastructure, creation of a portfolio of intellectual property, and administrative support. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of potential mRNA medicines unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and
obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our investigational medicines. If we seek to obtain regulatory approval for any of our investigational medicines, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continued operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can generate significant
revenue from potential mRNA medicines, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings, government funding arrangements, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution and
licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay,
scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our programs. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2018 will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations
through at least the next 12&nbsp;months. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical development, we are unable to
predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our medicines, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become
profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. </P>

Reorganization was exchanged for shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock, respectively, of Moderna Therapeutics, Inc.; (ii)&nbsp;previously outstanding incentive units of Moderna LLC were exchanged for shares of restricted

generated through collaboration arrangements and grants from government-sponsored and private organizations. Our collaboration arrangements typically contain multiple elements, or deliverables, including licenses, options to obtain development and
commercialization rights, research and development services, and obligations to develop and manufacture preclinical and clinical material. Such arrangements provide for various types of payments to us, including upfront payments, funding of research
and development activities, funding for the purchase of preclinical and clinical material, technical, development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, licensing fees, option exercise payments, and royalties based on product sales. We have
received grants from various government-sponsored and private organizations for research and related activities. Grant revenue is recognized in the period grant-related activities are performed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 808, <I>Collaborative Arrangements</I> (ASC&nbsp;808)
to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such
activities. For arrangements under the scope of ASC&nbsp;808, we recognize our allocation of the shared costs incurred with respect to the jointly conducted activities as a component of the related expense in the period incurred. We also consider
the guidance in FASB ASC Topic&nbsp;605-45, <I>Revenue Recognition&#151;Principal Agent Considerations</I> in determining the appropriate treatment for the transactions between us and the strategic collaborator and the transactions between us and
other third parties. The classification of transactions under the collaboration arrangements is determined based on the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement along with the nature of the operations of the participants. Any consideration
related to activities in which we are considered the principal, which includes being the primary obligor and having the risks and rewards of ownership, are accounted for as gross revenue. We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC
Topic&nbsp;605, <I>Revenue Recognition</I> (ASC&nbsp;605). Accordingly, revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met: (i)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii)&nbsp;delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, (iii)&nbsp;the seller&#146;s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably assured. We are often entitled to bill according to contractual terms of our collaboration

Revenue </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We analyze multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 605-25, <I>Revenue Recognition&#151;Multiple-Element
Arrangements </I>(ASC 605-25). Accordingly, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine: (i)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the arrangement; and (ii)&nbsp;whether each deliverable in the arrangement meets the criteria to be considered
a separate unit of accounting, or should be combined with other deliverables and accounted for as a single unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and
whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the arrangement. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i)&nbsp;the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis; and
(ii)&nbsp;if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), the delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has
standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities of the strategic collaborator and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether
the strategic collaborator can use the other deliverable(s) for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s) and whether there are other vendors
that can provide the undelivered element(s). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We allocate total consideration that is fixed or determinable to each unit of accounting based on the
relative selling price of each deliverable. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC&nbsp;605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting
within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (BESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is
available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price, since we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the
BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that
particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting when the last element to be delivered is provided to the customer. If the last
element to be delivered is provided over a period of time, revenue is recognized over our contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered elements, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations or
manufacturing obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement ratably over the estimated period of performance. Conversely,
if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the strategic collaborator can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance
method. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our third-party arrangements may include options for our strategic collaborators to acquire development and commercialization rights to mRNA

inception of the arrangement, we are at risk as to whether the strategic collaborator will choose to exercise the option. The evaluation of whether an option is substantive requires significant
judgment. In determining if the option is substantive, we consider the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the third-party might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, the likelihood that the option will be
exercised, or if the customer is required or compelled through significant incentive to exercise the option. When an option is considered substantive, we do not consider the option or item underlying the option to be a deliverable at inception of
the arrangement and the associated option fee is not included in the allocable arrangement consideration, assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, if we determine that an option is not substantive, we
will consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated option exercise fee is included in the allocable arrangement consideration. In addition, if the price of the option includes a
significant and incremental discount, then the option is not considered substantive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments,
we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either our
performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s)&nbsp;as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone; (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past
performance; and (iii)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be
overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of
the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. If milestones are considered substantive, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic&nbsp;605-28, <I>Revenue Recognition&#151;Milestone Method</I>, revenue from milestone payments is
recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone. Conversely, upon achievement of a milestone that is not considered substantive, the corresponding amount earned is considered additional arrangement consideration and
allocated to the identified units of accounting. Amounts allocated to any units of accounting for which performance has been partially completed are recognized, with a cumulative catch-up for the recognized portion of the unit of accounting when the
payment is earned. Revenue from commercial milestone payments will be accounted for as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying contract terms, provided that the reported sales

Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) are contracts, providing for reimbursed costs, which may include overhead and general and administrative costs as well as a related profit margin. We recognize revenue from these contracts as we perform
services under the arrangements so long as an agreement has been executed and the fees for the services are fixed or determinable, legally billable, and reasonably assured of collection. Recognized amounts reflect our performance under the
agreements. We do not recognize revenue under these agreements for amounts related to contract periods where funding is not yet committed, as fees above committed funding thresholds would not be considered fixed or determinable, or reasonably
assured of collection. Revenues and related expenses are presented gross in the consolidated statements of operations as we have determined we are the primary obligor under the arrangements relative to the research and development services we

property, we are required to account for the property as a depreciable asset and the related lease agreement must be accounted for as an imputed financing obligation. Significant judgments are required to make this determination, which relate to
actions, guarantees, and investments that we make as a lessee that may be actions that only an owner would take. Our Norwood manufacturing facility lease executed in August 2016 was subject to this lease accounting guidance. As we are involved in
the construction of our manufacturing facility, including being responsible for costs that did not qualify as normal tenant improvements, we are deemed to be the owner of the building during the construction period. During the Norwood construction
period, we capitalized the fair value of the building as of lease commencement as construction in progress along with a corresponding construction financing obligation in the consolidated balance sheets. Construction costs incurred were capitalized
in construction in progress including project management services, engineering services, design services and development, construction services and other construction-related fees and services. Once our Norwood manufacturing facility becomes
operational, these capitalized costs will be allocated to certain property and equipment categories and will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the underlying assets. The fair value of the building at lease commencement was determined
to be $12.5&nbsp;million by a third-party valuation specialist primarily using an income capitalization approach. The income capitalization approach was based on rents charged for competitive properties as adjusted for applicable expenses incurred
through ownership of the building and is considered a Level&nbsp;3 fair value measurement (Note&nbsp;7). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development Costs

measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to be in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided when the expected realization of deferred tax assets does not meet a
&#147;more likely than not&#148; criterion. We make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the
amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted. Changes in these estimates may result in significant increases or decreases to our tax provision in a period in which such estimates are changed, which in turn would affect net income
or loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if we believe the position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the

the effects of any reserves for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained, as well as the related net interest and penalties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior

the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed
earnings. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income (loss) for

common units outstanding prior to the 2016 Reorganization. The number of common units outstanding prior to the 2016 Reorganization were also retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split as if it occurred on January&nbsp;1, 2016.
Additionally, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, upon the 2016 Reorganization, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding reflects the impact of the exchange of common units and vested incentive units to common stock based on

aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. We adopted this standard as
of January&nbsp;1, 2017 and elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. We recorded the cumulative impact of applying this standard, and recognized a cumulative increase to additional paid-in capital and an increase to accumulated deficit of

most of the current revenue recognition guidance. Under Topic&nbsp;606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects
the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five
steps: (i)&nbsp;identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii)&nbsp;identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii)&nbsp;determine the transaction price; (iv)&nbsp;allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract; and (v)&nbsp;recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Topic&nbsp;606 also impacts certain other areas, such as the accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The standard also requires
disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Revenue ASUs will be effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2019. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Revenue ASUs allow for adoption using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. We are in process of determining which adoption
method we will utilize. We are also in process of assessing the effect of this accounting standard with regards to our revenue generating arrangements. Our performance obligations under our ongoing revenue recognition arrangements are not expected
to be completed prior to the adoption of these standards. We are anticipating changes in our revenue recognition policies as a result of these new standards, the most significant of which is expected to be the method of revenue recognition for
certain elements over time. Under the previous accounting standards, revenue was recognized ratably over the estimated period of performance while revenue will be recognized based on a proportional performance model under the Revenue ASUs. In
addition, we expect that the changes in accounting for contingent milestone payments will have a significant effect on the future accounting treatment for the arrangement. The previous accounting guidance contained specific guidance related to the
accounting for milestone payments including, if certain criteria were met, the ability to recognize all consideration related to the milestone once that milestone was achieved. The Revenue ASUs do not contain guidance specific to milestone payments,
thereby requiring potential milestone payments to be considered in accordance with the overall revenue recognition model. As a result, revenue from contingent milestone payments may be recognized earlier under the Revenue ASUs than under the
existing guidance, based on an assessment of the probability of achievement of the milestones and the likelihood of a significant reversal of such revenue at each reporting date. We will also be required to reassess the presentation of amounts as
either gross revenue or net within operating expenses under the Revenue ASUs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, <I>Leases</I>
(Topic&nbsp;842), which supersedes all existing lease guidance. This guidance offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. The new standard requires lessees to recognize an operating lease with a
term greater than one year on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lessees are required to classify leases as either finance or operating leases. If the
lease is effectively a financed-purchase by the lessee, it is classified as a financing lease, otherwise it is classified as an operating lease. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest
method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. ASC&nbsp;842 provides accounting guidance for transactions that meet specific criteria for a leaseback transaction. If the criteria are not met, the transaction is considered a
&#147;failed sale&#148; and the transaction must be accounted for as a financing arrangement. The new standard will be effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2020. Upon adoption, lessees must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for
leases existing at, or entered after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact ASU 2016-02 may have on our financial position and results of operations.
Our assessment will include, but is not limited to, evaluating the impact that this standard has on the lease of our corporate headquarters at 200 Technology Square in Cambridge, MA, the lease of our office and laboratory space at 500 Technology
Square, Cambridge, MA and our manufacturing facility in Norwood, MA, for which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes under our current accounting policies, and the identification of any embedded leases. </P>

AstraZeneca certain exclusive rights and licenses, and options to obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize potential therapeutic mRNA medicines directed at certain targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases
and cancer, and agreed to provide related services to AstraZeneca. Pursuant to the 2013 AZ Agreements, AstraZeneca was responsible for all research, development and commercialization activities, while we provided specified research and manufacturing
services during a research and evaluation period, as described below, to further AstraZeneca&#146;s activities pursuant to an agreed upon services plan. Under the 2013 AZ Agreements, AstraZeneca could have requested we provide additional services,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Option Agreement and a related Amended and Restated Services and Collaboration Agreement with
AstraZeneca, or the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements, which amended and restated the 2013 AZ Agreements. Under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements, we granted AstraZeneca certain exclusive rights and licenses to research, develop and commercialize potential
therapeutic mRNA medicines directed at certain targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases and cancer, and agreed to provide related services to AstraZeneca. The activities to be performed by the parties under the 2018
A&amp;R Agreements are limited to defined biological targets in the cardiovascular and cardiometabolic fields and one defined target in the cancer field. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements, AstraZeneca is responsible for all research, development and commercialization activities and associated costs, while
we provide specified research and manufacturing services during a research and evaluation period, as described below, to further AstraZeneca&#146;s activities conducted pursuant to an agreed upon services plan. During this research and evaluation
period, these research services, and manufacturing services in excess of a specified threshold, are provided at AstraZeneca&#146;s expense, and manufacturing services below the specified threshold are provided at no additional expense to
AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca may request we provide additional research and manufacturing services, at AstraZeneca&#146;s expense, following the end of the research and evaluation period. Subject to customary &#147;back-up&#148; supply rights granted to
AstraZeneca, we exclusively manufacture (or have manufactured) mRNA for all research, development and commercialization purposes under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements until, on a product-by-product basis, the expiration of the time period for which we
are entitled to receive earn-out payments with respect to such product pursuant to the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of the effective date of the 2013 AZ
Agreements, and as further reflected in the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements, AstraZeneca acquired forty options that it may exercise to obtain exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize identified development candidates (and related back-up
candidates) directed to specified targets that arise during the research and evaluation period. During the research and evaluation period for research candidates, AstraZeneca may elect to designate a limited number of research candidates as
development candidates in order to continue preclinical development on such development candidates (and related back-up candidates). From such pool of development candidates designated by AstraZeneca, during a specified option exercise period,
AstraZeneca may then exercise one of its options to obtain exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize an identified development candidate (and related back-up candidates) in certain fields. If AstraZeneca does not exercise one of its
options to acquire exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize a particular development candidate during the defined option exercise period for such development candidate, AstraZeneca&#146;s rights to exercise an option and other rights
granted under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements with respect to such development candidate (and related back-up candidates) will terminate, all rights to exploit such development candidate (and related back-up candidates) will be returned to us and all
data and results generated by AstraZeneca with respect to such development candidate (and related back-up candidates) will be either assigned or licensed to us. Upon the earlier of termination of the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements for any reason and a

Agreement and Services and Collaboration Agreement </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determined that the AZ 2013 Agreements should be evaluated as a single contract for accounting
purposes as the AZ Services Agreement and the AZ Option Agreement were negotiated in contemplation of one another and executed contemporaneously. We concluded the 2013 AZ Agreements are under the scope of ASC 808 as AstraZeneca and Moderna are both
active participants and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on commercial success of the activities of the arrangement. Additionally, we evaluated the 2013 AZ Agreements for recognition and measurement in accordance with
ASC&nbsp;605-25 and ASC&nbsp;605-28. Prior to the 2016 AZ Agreement, we determined there were multiple deliverables in the 2013 AZ Agreements, including the licenses to exploit mRNA constructs coding for specific targets, research services,
development pool services, supply of mRNA for research activities, and supply of mRNA for development pool activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded that the licenses to
exploit mRNA constructs coding for specific targets does not qualify for separation from any of other deliverables as AstraZeneca cannot fully exploit the value of the licenses without receipt of such services and supply. Our services and supply
involve specialized expertise, particularly as it relates to mRNA technology that is not available in the marketplace. Accordingly, AstraZeneca has to obtain the research services, development pool services, supply of mRNA for research activities,
and supply of mRNA for development pool activities from us, which significantly limits the ability for AstraZeneca to fully exploit the licenses for their intended purpose on a standalone basis. Accordingly, we concluded the delivered licenses do
not have standalone value from the undelivered elements and we accounted for all of the deliverables as one unit of accounting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded that the
options to obtain exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize up to forty development candidates (and related backup candidates) for identified cardiovascular/cardiometabolic or oncology targets were substantive and therefore not
considered a deliverable at the inception of the 2013 AZ Agreements, as AstraZeneca is not contractually obligated to exercise the options, and we are at risk with regard to whether AstraZeneca will exercise the options as a result of the uncertain
outcome of the research and development activities. Additionally, research and development services and certain mRNA supply outside of the specified deliverables, including clinical development supply, were determined to be substantive and therefore
not considered a deliverable at the inception of the 2013 AZ Agreements. Further, we concluded that the options and the additional mRNA supply were not priced at a significant or incremental discount. Accordingly, AstraZeneca&#146;s options and
additional mRNA supply were not considered deliverables and the associated fees were not included in the allocable arrangement consideration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The total
arrangement consideration allocated to the single unit of accounting was the $240.0 million upfront pursuant to the 2013 AZ Agreements. We determined the period of performance for the research services,

development pool services, supply of mRNA for research activities, and supply of mRNA for development pool activities is ten years. As such, the $240.0 million arrangement consideration is being
recognized ratably over the such ten years is no other discernible pattern of recognition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluated the contingent payments that we were eligible to
receive under the 2013 AZ Agreements upon the achievement of certain technical, development, regulatory, and commercial milestone events. More specifically, we could have received additional payments of up to $180.0 million contingent on the
achievement of three technical milestones for certain toxicity, delivery, and competition criteria that were not related to a specific product candidate. Such payments were payable only once, regardless of the number of options exercised. In
addition, upon AstraZeneca&#146;s exercise of each option, we were eligible to receive certain payments contingent upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory, and commercial events. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded at the outset of the arrangement that two of the three technical milestones that are not related to a specific product candidate, specifically,
the toxicity milestone and the delivery milestone, were substantive as the efforts to achieve the milestone are our responsibility and therefore achieved based on our past performances. Further, we concluded that these milestones were substantive on
the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone, in consideration of factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone as well as the level of effort and investment required.
Accordingly, payments upon the achievement of each of these substantive milestone events will be recognized as revenue in full in the period in which the associated milestone is achieved. We determined that the competition milestone did not qualify
as substantive, as it was based, in part, on the performance of our competitors and therefore not achieved solely based on our past performances. Similarly, we concluded at the outset of the arrangement that none of the development and regulatory
milestones qualified as substantive milestones, as the efforts to achieve the milestones are AstraZeneca&#146;s responsibility and therefore the milestone is not achieved based on our past performances. Accordingly, upon achievement of a
non-substantive milestone, the contingent payment earned will be recognized as additional arrangement consideration over the remaining estimated period of performance, if any, with a cumulative catch up for the elapsed portion of the performance
period being recognized when the payment is earned. The contingent payments upon the achievement of all commercial milestones will be accounted for in the same manner as royalties, and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming
all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying agreement terms, provided that the reported sales are reliably measurable, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria are met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we achieved two contingent technical milestones that were not related
to a specific product candidate, the toxicity milestone and the competition milestone, pursuant to the 2013 AZ Agreements. As the toxicity milestone was determined to be substantive, the payment of $60.0&nbsp;million was recognized as revenue in
2015. As the competition milestone was determined to be non-substantive, the payment of $60.0 million is being recognized as additional arrangement consideration over the remaining estimated period of performance, with a cumulative catch up for the
elapsed portion of the performance period being recognized when the payment was earned. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recognized $16.2&nbsp;million in revenue for the achievement of the competition milestone event, including a
cumulative catch up of $15.7 million from the effective date of the agreement to the achievement date of the respective milestone. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognized $0.6

a material modification to the 2013 AZ Agreements and therefore should be evaluated with the 2013 AZ Agreements as a single contract. For the purposes of this accounting treatment discussion, we refer to the 2013 AZ Agreements and the 2016 AZ
Agreement collectively as the 2013/2016 AZ Agreements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluated the 2013/2016 AZ Agreements in accordance with ASC&nbsp;605-25. We determined there
were multiple deliverables in the 2013/2016 AZ Agreements including: (i)&nbsp;licenses to exploit mRNA constructs coding for specific targets from the 2013 Agreements, (ii)&nbsp;research services from the 2013 Agreements, (iii)&nbsp;development pool

AstraZeneca was not obligated to exercise its options to obtain the respective development and commercialization rights, they could exercise the option for no additional consideration. As such, we concluded there was no significant risk as to
whether AstraZeneca would exercise its options. Therefore, the development and commercialization rights were included as deliverables at the inception of the 2016 AZ Agreement. Additionally, as it relates to the option to obtain exclusive rights to
clinically develop and commercialize development candidates for identified cardiovascular, cardiometabolic or oncology targets pursuant to the 2013 AZ Agreements and the right to receive additional manufacturing and research services, consistent
with the initial assessment of the 2013 AZ Agreements, we concluded that such options are substantive as there was still significant uncertainty as to whether AstraZeneca would exercise the options and therefore such options were not considered a
deliverable at the date of the modification. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Consistent with the initial assessment of the 2013 AZ Agreements, we concluded as of the modification date
that the licenses to exploit mRNA constructs coding for specific targets does not qualify for separation from the research services, development pool services, and supply of mRNA for research activities and development pool activities as AstraZeneca
cannot fully exploit the value of the licenses without receipt of such services and supply. Accordingly, the licenses do not have standalone value from the research services, development pool services, and supply of mRNA for research activities and
development pool activities and we accounted for these deliverables as one unit of accounting. As it relates to the additional deliverables pursuant to the 2016 AZ Agreement, we concluded the preclinical development obligations for each research
program qualify for separation from each other and from the other deliverables as AstraZeneca will benefit from the results of the respective toxicology studies and product development to determine whether to nominate the respective product
candidate for further development. Therefore, we concluded the preclinical development obligations for each research program have standalone value from the undelivered elements and represent a separate unit of accounting for each program.
Additionally, we concluded that each of the development and commercialization rights do not qualify for separation from the related manufacturing and supply services for the respective program. This is primarily because AstraZeneca has to rely on us
to provide the related manufacturing and supply services to fully exploit the value of the respective development and commercialize rights. Accordingly, we accounted for the development and commercialization rights and the related manufacturing and

Accordingly, the selling price of each unit of accounting was determined based on our BESP. We developed the BESP for all units of accounting with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such item if it were to be sold

units of accounting that included a manufacturing and supply component, we considered the nature and duration of our obligation and estimates of the associated effort and cost of the manufacturing, adjusted for a reasonable profit margin that would
be expected to be realized under similar arrangements. For units of accounting that included a license component, we considered the probability weighted present value of expected future cash flows associated with each license related to the specific

the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the associated license. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total estimated arrangement consideration under the 2016 AZ

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2016, AstraZeneca exercised its option to obtain development and commercialization rights for an
identified development candidate (AZD8601) (and related back-up candidates) under the 2013 AZ Agreements. We concluded such option was substantive and was not considered a deliverable in the 2013 AZ Agreements, under the 2013/2016 AZ Agreements or
under the 2018 A&amp;R Agreements. In conjunction with the option exercise, we received $10.0 million upon the option exercise and are entitled to reimbursement of the manufacturing cost of the clinical supply. In May 2018, we received a $30.0
million (unaudited) payment upon the achievement of a clinical event related to AZD8601. We determined the deliverables pertaining to option exercise are: (i)&nbsp;the right to develop and commercialize the product candidate (and related back-up
candidates) and (ii)&nbsp;the related clinical supply of mRNA. We concluded that the right to develop and commercialize the identified development candidate (and related back-up candidates) does not qualify for separation from the related clinical
supply of mRNA. This is primarily due to the fact that AstraZeneca must rely upon us to provide the related clinical supply of mRNA to fully exploit the value of the respective development and commercialize rights. Accordingly, we concluded the
delivered item does not have standalone value from the undelivered element and we accounted for the deliverables as a combined unit of accounting. Arrangement consideration consists of: (i)&nbsp;the product option fee of $10.0 million; (ii)&nbsp;the
$30.0 million (unaudited) clinical event payment; and (iii)&nbsp;the estimated reimbursement for the clinical supply of mRNA. However, we could not reasonably estimate the consideration pertaining to the clinical supply of mRNA as the supply
requirements are uncertain until the Phase&nbsp;3 study design is complete. Therefore, total arrangement consideration could not be reasonably estimated as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 or September 30, 2018. As a result, the $10.0 million
product option fee and the $30.0 million (unaudited) clinical event payment have been deferred and will continue to be, along with future consideration received, until the consideration pertaining to the clinical supply of mRNA can be reasonably
estimated. Once the total arrangement consideration can be estimated, the arrangement consideration will be recognized as the clinical supply is provided to AstraZeneca for use in the clinical trial. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded the 2017 AZ Agreement is under the scope of ASC 808 as AstraZeneca and Moderna are both active participants in the development, manufacturing and
commercialization activities and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on commercial success of the activities of the arrangement. Additionally, we determined the development, manufacturing and commercialization activities
are not deliverables under ASC&nbsp;605-25. As a result, the activities conducted pursuant to the development, manufacturing and commercialization activities will be accounted for as a component of the related expense in the period incurred. We
considered ASC&nbsp;605-45 in determining the appropriate treatment for the transactions between AstraZeneca and Moderna and concluded that reimbursement for transactions in which we are considered to be the principal, which includes being the
primary obligor and having the risks and rewards of ownership, are accounted for as gross revenue. No revenue was recognized from the 2017 AZ Agreement in 2017. </P>

Merck Agreement, Merck is primarily responsible for research, development and commercialization activities and associated costs. We are responsible for designing and manufacturing all mRNA
constructs for preclinical and Phase&nbsp;1 and Phase&nbsp;2 clinical development purposes. In addition, we are responsible for performing collaboration and design activities set forth in a platform work plan, a proof of biology work plan and
Moderna development program work plans. Responsibility for manufacturing mRNA constructs for late stage clinical development and commercialization purposes is to be determined. A Joint Steering Committee comprised of representatives of each party
oversees the performance of collaboration activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The focus of the initial four-year period of the 2015 Merck Agreement, ending in January 2019, is
the discovery and development of mRNA vaccines and antibodies directed to the four viruses that are the subject of the 2015 Merck Agreement. The 2015 Merck Agreement also includes an additional three-year period during which Merck may continue to
preclinically and clinically develop product candidates that arise from the initial four-year research period. Merck may, prior to the end of the seventh year of the 2015 Merck Agreement, elect to exclusively develop and commercialize up to five
product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the four-year discovery and development phase of the alliance, we and Merck will work exclusively with each other to develop
potential mRNA medicines for the prevention and treatment of infections by the four viruses that are the subject of the 2015 Merck Agreement. Additionally, we and Merck have agreed to certain defined exclusivity obligations following the four-year
discovery and development phase of the alliance. Under the 2015 Merck Agreement, we grant certain licenses to Merck to enable Merck to perform its collaboration activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the 2015 Merck Agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront payment. We are eligible to receive, on a product-by-product basis, up to
$65.0 million in payments for achievement of development milestones, up to $60.0 million in payments for achievement of regulatory milestones and up to $175.0 million in payments for achievement of commercial milestones. As of December&nbsp;31,
2017, we have received from Merck a clinical milestone payment of $5.0 million with respect to the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial for a Merck RSV vaccine product candidate. On a product-by-product basis, we are also entitled to receive
royalties on Merck&#146;s net sales of products at rates ranging from the mid-single digits to low teens, subject to certain reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor. Additionally, concurrent with entering into the 2015 Merck Agreement, Merck
made a $50.0 million equity investment in Moderna. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unless earlier terminated, the 2015 Merck Agreement will continue on a product-by-product and

a particular program, product candidate, product or country, subject to specified notice and cure provisions. Merck may terminate the 2015 Merck Agreement, in full or with respect to a particular product candidate or product upon certain advance
notice to us for any reason, or earlier if Merck determines the alliance or product is no longer commercially practicable. If Merck has the right to terminate the 2015 Merck Agreement, in its entirety or with respect to a program, product candidate
or product, for our material breach, then Merck may elect, in lieu of terminating the 2015 Merck Agreement to have the 2015 Merck Agreement remain in effect, subject to reductions in certain payments we are eligible to receive with respect to the
terminable rights. Upon a termination of the 2015 Merck Agreement with respect to a program, all licenses and other rights granted to Merck with respect to such program will terminate and the continued development and commercialization of product
candidates and products will revert to us. If the 2015 Merck Agreement is terminated with respect to a given product candidate or product, all licenses and other rights granted to Merck with respect to such product candidate or product will
terminate and, to the extent we terminated for Merck&#146;s breach, Merck will grant us licenses under select Merck technology for our continued development and commercialization of such product candidate or product. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2016, we expanded our infectious disease strategic alliance with Merck. Specifically, we and Merck agreed to amend the original 2015 Merck Agreement
to include the research, development, and commercialization of mRNA medicines for the prevention and treatment of infection by the varicella zoster virus in place of one of the viruses initially included under the 2015 Merck Agreement. Under the
terms of the amended 2015 Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $10.0 million from Merck for the inclusion of the new program and we agreed with Merck to increase the royalty rates ranging from the mid-single digits to low-teens for net
sales of products directed to this virus. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Accounting Treatment </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded the 2015 Merck Agreement should be accounted for separately from Merck&#146;s investment in our Series&nbsp;E redeemable convertible preferred
stock, as the agreements are not interrelated or interdependent on each other. Further, the investment in the Series&nbsp;E redeemable convertible preferred stock was negotiated with terms representative of fair value at the same purchase price paid
by other investors. As such, the proceeds related to the equity investment were excluded from the consideration related to the 2015 Merck Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
concluded the 2015 Merck Agreement is under the scope of ASC&nbsp;808 as Merck and Moderna are both active participants and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on commercial success of the activities of the arrangement.
Additionally, we evaluated the 2015 Merck Agreement for recognition and measurement in accordance with ASC&nbsp;605-25 and ASC&nbsp;605-28. The agreement contains multiple deliverables, including the licenses for collaboration activities, our
performance of certain collaboration activities, mRNA design activities, our performance of platform work plan activities, our performance of proof of biology program activities, our performance of activities for the Moderna development programs,
manufacturing of non-cGMP mRNA, exclusivity and participation in joint steering committee services. In addition, clinical mRNA supply for Phase&nbsp;1 and Phase&nbsp;2 was concluded to be substantive and therefore not considered a deliverable at the
inception of the 2015 Merck Agreement. Further, we concluded that the clinical mRNA supply was not priced at a significant or incremental discount. Accordingly, the clinical mRNA supply was not considered a deliverable and the associated fees were
not included in the allocable arrangement consideration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded the licenses for performing collaboration activities do not qualify for separation
from any of the other deliverables in the agreement as Merck cannot fully exploit the value of such licenses without receipt of mRNA design services and non-cGMP mRNA supply from us. The products and services to be provided by us, which involve
specialized expertise, particularly as it relates to mRNA technology, are not available in the marketplace. Accordingly, Merck has to obtain such services and supply pursuant to the collaboration activities, design activities, platform work plan,
proof of biology program, development programs, manufacturing of non-cGMP mRNA, exclusivity and joint steering committee services from us which significantly limits the ability for Merck to utilize such licenses for its intended purpose on a
standalone basis. Accordingly, the delivered licenses do not have standalone value from the undelivered elements and we accounted for all of the deliverables as one unit of accounting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The total arrangement consideration to be allocated to the single unit of accounting at inception of the arrangement consists of the $50.0 million upfront
payment and estimated amounts related to research and development services and manufacturing that are included in the unit of accounting. We determined the period of performance of the undelivered elements is commensurate with the four-year
discovery and development phase of the collaboration. As such, the $50.0 million arrangement consideration will be recognized ratably over the four-year period, as there is no other discernible pattern of recognition. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have evaluated all the milestones that may be received under the arrangement. We concluded at the outset
of the arrangement that none of the future development and regulatory milestones qualified as substantive milestones, as the efforts to achieve the milestones are Merck&#146;s responsibility and therefore the milestone is not achieved based on our
past performance. Accordingly, upon achievement of a development or regulatory milestone event, the corresponding amount earned will be recognized as additional arrangement consideration over the remaining estimated period of performance, if any,
with a cumulative catch up for the elapsed portion of the performance period being recognized when the payment is earned. All commercial milestones will be accounted for in the same manner as royalties, and recorded as revenue upon achievement of
the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying agreement terms, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are
met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognized $2.1 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, related to the performance of certain
manufacturing services which were considered substantive options in the arrangement. These services are recognized as they are performed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determined
the 2016 amendment of the 2015 Merck Agreement, to replace one of Merck&#146;s exclusive viruses, should be combined with the original 2015 Merck Agreement and the comparable deliverables associated with the new virus should be combined with the
deliverables from the original 2015 Merck Agreements into a single unit of accounting. As such, the $10.0 million of consideration pertaining to the amendment was added to the remaining deferred revenue at the time of modification and is being
recognized ratably over the remaining period of performance which is commensurate with the remaining discovery and development phase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the years ended

the Merck 2015 Agreement and the 2016 Amendment. We had deferred revenue of $32.1 million, $16.3 million and $4.4&nbsp;million (unaudited), as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, respectively, from the Merck 2015

which we refer to as the PCV Agreement, to develop and commercialize PCVs for individual patients using our mRNA vaccine and formulation technology. Under the strategic alliance, we identify genetic mutations present in a particular patient&#146;s
tumor cells, synthesize mRNA for these mutations, encapsulate the mRNA in one of our proprietary LNPs and administer to each patient a unique mRNA cancer vaccine designed to specifically activate the patient&#146;s immune system against her or his

responsible for conducting and funding preclinical discovery and research activities for such SAVs, and otherwise the programs would be conducted on substantially the same terms as mRNA-5671 program. If we or Merck propose a new SAV program and the
other party does not agree to conduct such program, then the PCV/SAV Agreement includes provisions allowing the proposing party to proceed with such development, at the proposing party&#146;s expense. If Merck is the proposing party, we will be
responsible for manufacturing and supplying material for such program at Merck&#146;s expense. In such case, the non-proposing party will have the right to opt-in to such SAV program any time before the proposing party commits to performing Good
Laboratory Practice (GLP)-toxicity studies. Until the expiration of a defined period of time following our completion of Phase&nbsp;1 and Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials for any SAV program mutually agreed by the parties under the PCV/SAV Agreement and

in contemplation of one another and the elements within each of the agreements are not closely interrelated or interdependent on each other. We concluded the PCV Agreement is under the scope of ASC 808 as Merck and Moderna are both active
participants and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on commercial success of the activities of the arrangement. Additionally, we evaluated the PCV Agreement for recognition and measurement in accordance with the
provisions of ASC&nbsp;605-25 and ASC&nbsp;605-28. The arrangement contains multiple deliverables, including licenses to perform collaboration activities under the proof of concept (POC) plan, collaboration research and development activities,

additional POC term study, POC committee services, exclusivity, regulatory matters, manufacturing and supply of PCVs during the POC period, manufacturing capabilities and clinical quality agreement from us, which significantly limits the ability for
Merck to utilize such licenses for its intended purpose on a standalone basis. As the delivered licenses do not have standalone value from the undelivered elements, we accounted for all of the deliverables as one unit of accounting. </P>

the equity investment in our Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock was considered together with the PCV/SAV Agreement as the transactions were executed contemporaneously in contemplation of one another. Further, the purchase price paid by
Merck with respect to the investment in the Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock was not representative of fair value on the date of such purchase. As such, the incremental proceeds received in excess of the fair value of the underlying

that the licenses to perform the collaboration activities for the KRAS program do not qualify for separation from the associated manufacturing and supply of mRNA-5671 as Merck cannot fully exploit the value of such licenses without receipt of such

collaboration revenue of $3.5 million, $9.1&nbsp;million, $6.8&nbsp;million (unaudited) and $9.0&nbsp;million (unaudited), respectively, from Vertex. We had deferred revenue of $16.7 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million (unaudited), as of

Diseases </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2014, we entered into an Option Agreement and a related Services and Collaboration Agreement, which we refer to as the 2014
Alexion Agreements, with Alexion Pharma Holding Unlimited Company (Alexion) to research, develop and commercialize potential therapeutic mRNA medicines for the treatment of certain rare diseases. Pursuant to the 2014 Alexion Agreements, we granted
certain licenses to Alexion and we provided specified research and manufacturing services pursuant to an agreed upon services plan. Under the 2014 Alexion Agreements, Alexion could have requested we provide additional services, at Alexion&#146;s
expense, following the end of the research and evaluation period. Under the terms of the 2014 Alexion Agreements, we received an upfront payment of $100.0 million from Alexion. On July&nbsp;27, 2017, Alexion exercised its right to terminate the 2014
Alexion Agreements without cause effective as of October&nbsp;25, 2017. At the time of termination, Alexion had not exercised any options to acquire rights to develop and commercialize any products. Upon the termination of the 2014 Alexion
Agreements, all rights to mRNA researched, developed or supplied as a part of the programs under the 2014 Alexion Agreements reverted back to us. During the term of the 2014 Alexion Agreements, the parties were subject to certain exclusivity
obligations. In connection with entering into the 2014 Alexion Agreements, Alexion also made a $25.0 million equity investment in us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Accounting
Treatment </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determined that the 2014 Alexion Agreements should be evaluated as a single contract for accounting purposes as the Option Agreement and
the Services and Collaboration Agreement were negotiated in contemplation of one another. Additionally, we concluded the 2014 Alexion Agreements should be accounted for separately from Alexion&#146;s $25.0 million investment in our Series&nbsp;D
redeemable convertible preferred stock, as the agreements are not interrelated or interdependent on each other. Further, the investment in the Series&nbsp;D redeemable convertible preferred stock was negotiated with terms representative of fair
value at the same purchase price paid by other investors. As such, the proceeds related to the equity investment were excluded from the consideration related to the 2014 Alexion Agreements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded the 2014 Alexion Agreements are under the scope of ASC&nbsp;808 as Alexion and Moderna are both active participants and are exposed to
significant risks and rewards that are dependent on commercial success of the activities of the arrangements. Additionally, we evaluated the 2014 Alexion Agreements for recognition and measurement in accordance with ASC&nbsp;605-25 and
ASC&nbsp;605-28. The deliverables in the arrangement contain multiple deliverables, including evaluation licenses for certain mRNA constructs coding for specific targets, research services, development pool services, mRNA coding for research
polypeptides, research phase API, and exclusivity. In addition, we concluded that Alexion&#146;s options to acquire rights to develop and commercialize up to ten development candidates were substantive options and therefore not considered a
deliverable at the inception of the 2014 Alexion Agreements. Alexion was not contractually obligated to exercise such options. As a result of the uncertain outcome of the research and development activities, we were at risk as to whether Alexion
would exercise the options. Additionally, clinical mRNA supply was determined to be substantive and therefore not considered a deliverable at the inception of the 2014 Alexion Agreements. Further, we concluded

that Alexion&#146;s options and the clinical mRNA supply were not priced at a significant or incremental discount. Accordingly, Alexion&#146;s options and the clinical mRNA supply were not
considered a deliverable and the associated fees were not included in the allocable arrangement consideration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We concluded that the evaluation licenses
for certain mRNA constructs coding for specific targets did not qualify for separation from any of the other deliverables in the arrangement as Alexion could not fully exploit the value of these licenses without receipt of such services and supply.
Our services and supply involve specialized expertise, particularly as it relates to mRNA technology that is not available in the marketplace. Accordingly, Alexion had to obtain the research services, development pool services, mRNA coding for
research polypeptides, research phase API, and exclusivity from us, which significantly limited Alexion&#146;s ability to utilize the licenses for their intended purposes on a standalone basis. Accordingly, the delivered licenses did not have
standalone value from the undelivered elements and we accounted for all of the deliverables as one unit of accounting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The total arrangement
consideration allocated to the single unit of accounting at inception consisted of the $100.0&nbsp;million upfront payment and estimated amounts related to research and development services and manufacturing that are included in the unit of
accounting. We determined the period of performance of the undelivered elements was commensurate with the ten-year services term. As such, the $100.0 million arrangement consideration was being recognized ratably over the ten-year period, as there
was no other discernible pattern of recognition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon exercise of each option, we were eligible to receive, per product candidate, certain payments
contingent upon achievement of development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. At the time of termination, no milestones had been achieved. We evaluated all of the milestones that may have been received under the arrangement. We concluded at the
outset of the arrangement that none of the future development and regulatory milestones qualified as substantive milestones, as the efforts to achieve the milestones were Alexion&#146;s responsibility and therefore the milestone would not be
achieved based on our past performance. Accordingly, upon achievement of a development or regulatory milestone event, the corresponding amount earned would have been recognized as additional arrangement consideration over the remaining estimated
performance period, if any, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the performance period being recognized in full when the payment was earned. All commercial milestones would have been accounted for in the same manner as royalties,
and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria were met. We would have recognized royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related product(s), based on the underlying agreement terms,
provided that the reported sales were reliably measurable and we had no remaining undelivered elements, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria were met. No options were exercised and therefore no milestones or royalties were earned under
the 2014 Alexion Agreements prior to termination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In conjunction with the termination of the 2014 Alexion Agreements in 2017, we determined there were no
remaining deliverables pursuant to the 2014 Alexion Agreements as the agreements and all unexercised options were terminated. Therefore, $70.3 million of deferred revenue was recognized in full upon the termination in 2017. There were no other
amounts for which we were entitled pursuant to the termination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, and the nine months ended September
30, 2017, we recognized collaboration revenue of $17.2 million, $74.4 million, and $12.2&nbsp;million (unaudited), respectively, from Alexion. We had no collaboration revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from Alexion. We had
deferred revenue of $70.3 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. We had no deferred revenue as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and September 30, 2018, respectively, from Alexion. </P>

expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis. We have two campuses in Massachusetts. We occupy a multi-building campus in Technology Square in Cambridge, MA with a mix of offices and research laboratory space totaling 190,712&nbsp;square

occupy the premises in six phases which started in September 2016, with the last phase estimated to begin in December&nbsp;2020. We have the option to extend the lease term for two extension periods of five&nbsp;years each, at market-based rates. In
addition to rent payments, the lease also provides that we pay our proportionate share of operating expenses and taxes during the term of the lease. As the amount of square footage to be leased increases over the term of the lease, we will recognize
each phase&#146;s total rent payments on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. The lease provides us with an initial tenant allowance of $10.00 per square foot against which costs incurred will be capitalized as leasehold
improvements. We have provided a security deposit of $1.3 million, that is classified as non-current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. As we occupy additional space through the six phases of occupancy, the security deposit will

improvement allowance against which costs incurred will be capitalized as leasehold improvements. The lease also provides that we pay our proportionate share of operating expenses and taxes during the term of the lease. We will record rent expense
on a straight-line basis through the end of the lease term, inclusive of the period in which there are no scheduled rent payments, and will record deferred rent on the consolidated balance sheet, accordingly. We have provided a security deposit of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August&nbsp;2016, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 200,000 square feet of office, laboratory, and light manufacturing space in Norwood,
MA. The lease commencement date for accounting purposes was October&nbsp;1, 2016. In connection with this lease, the landlord provided a tenant improvement allowance of approximately $24.2 million for costs associated with the design, engineering,
and construction of tenant improvements for the building. For accounting purposes, we were deemed to be the owner of the building during the construction period as we were involved in the construction project, including having responsibilities for
cost overruns for planned tenant improvements that did not qualify as normal tenant improvements under the lease accounting guidance. During the construction period, we capitalized the fair value of the building as of lease commencement along with a
corresponding construction financing obligation. We also capitalized project construction costs incurred by us as an asset. Property and equipment, net included $18.2&nbsp;million and $75.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017,
respectively, related to construction in process costs for the building. We completed the construction of the building and started our Norwood operation in July 2018. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we transferred $139.8 million of
construction in process to property and equipment, including the building of $130.7 million. Certain manufacturing equipment and processes are still in progress which are expected to be completed in 2019. The carrying value of the construction
financing obligation related to the building, was $12.5&nbsp;million, $15.7 million and $26.9&nbsp;million (unaudited), as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, respectively. We recorded $14.5&nbsp;million and
$4.3&nbsp;million (unaudited) in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the construction period, we bifurcated our future lease payments pursuant to the lease into: (i)&nbsp;a portion that is allocated to the building; and
(ii)&nbsp;a portion that is allocated to the land on which the building is located, which is recorded as rental expense. The fair value of the building and the land were estimated by us with the assistance of a third-party valuation expert and
giving consideration to comparable properties. Although we did not begin making lease payments pursuant to the lease until October&nbsp;2017, the portion of the lease obligation allocated to the land is treated for accounting purposes as an
operating lease commencing on October&nbsp;1, 2016. Rent expense, comprised solely of land rent, of approximately $0.2 million and $1.3 million was incurred during </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2016 or 2017 relating to capitalized construction costs as the building had not been placed in service. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon completion of the
construction of the building, we evaluated the lease and determined that it did not meet the criteria for &#147;sale-leaseback&#148; treatment. Accordingly, we depreciate the building and incur interest expense related to the construction financing
obligation recorded on our balance sheet. We bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the lease into: (i) a portion that is allocated to the building; and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the building was constructed. The
portion of the lease obligation allocated to land is treated as an operating lease<I>. </I> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The lease will terminate in September&nbsp;2032. We have the
option to extend the term for two extension periods of ten&nbsp;years each at market-based rents. The base rent is subject to increases over the term of the lease. We have provided a security deposit of $8.9&nbsp;million that is classified as
non-current restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 and September 30, 2018 (unaudited). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In

royalties on future net sales and milestone payments contingent on achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones for specified products, on a product-by-product basis. We concluded the assets acquired in connection with
the sublicense agreements should be accounted for as an asset acquisition of in-process research and development. Accordingly, all payments to be made that meet the characteristics of research and development expenses with no alternative future use
will be expensed in the period in which they are incurred. As such, the initial sublicense payments totaling $28.0&nbsp;million were expensed at inception and future sublicense payments will be recorded when it becomes certain we will be obliged to
make the future payments. Additionally, the development and regulatory milestone payments, up to $1.5 million for therapeutic and prophylactic products and up to $0.5 million for diagnostic products will be recognized as a cost of the asset acquired
upon resolution of the associated contingency and will be capitalized or expensed depending on the nature of the associated asset as of the date of recognition. Conversely, commercial milestone payments, up to $24.0 million for therapeutic and
prophylactic products will be accounted for as additional expense of the related product sales in the period in which the corresponding sales occur. In conjunction with the agreements entered in 2017, we recognized expense of $53.3&nbsp;million, and
paid consideration of $28.3&nbsp;million in 2017. We recorded $25.0&nbsp;million of accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. In the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2018, we paid Cellscript, LLC $22.0

redeemable convertible preferred stock (unaudited) and 5,000,000 shares of Series&nbsp;H redeemable convertible preferred stock (unaudited), respectively. Series&nbsp;G redeemable convertible preferred stock was issued at a purchase price of $10.06
per share (unaudited) for gross proceeds of $560.0 million (unaudited), less issuance costs of $10.5&nbsp;million (unaudited). Series&nbsp;H redeemable convertible preferred stock was issued at a purchase price of $25.00 per share (unaudited) for
gross proceeds of $112.0&nbsp;million (unaudited), less issuance costs of $0.4 million (unaudited). The Series H preferred stock is not convertible at the option of the holder until after February&nbsp;7, 2020, after which, it will be convertible
into common stock on a one-for-2.485 basis because the applicable original issuance price for such series is $25.00 and the initial applicable conversion price is $10.06. The initial carrying amount of the Series&nbsp;H redeemable convertible
preferred stock was recorded at its fair value of $22.39 per share (unaudited), which we determined based in part on an independent third-party valuation contemporaneously performed. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of
Series&nbsp;H redeemable convertible preferred stock was determined to be the premium associated with the Merck PCV/SAV Agreement entered in conjunction with the Series&nbsp;H issuance and recorded to deferred revenue of $13.0&nbsp;million

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as of May 7, 2018 the redeemable convertible preferred stock does not have any
redemption rights that are at the election of the holder. However, the redeemable convertible preferred stock is entitled to payment upon the occurrence of certain contingent events. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As it relates to the payment upon the occurrence of a contingent event, we evaluated the redeemable convertible preferred stock in accordance with the
guidance in FASB ASC Topic&nbsp;480, <I>Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity</I> (ASC&nbsp;480), and determined that the payment of liquidation amounts due upon the occurrence of a contingent event is not solely within our control and accordingly
the redeemable convertible preferred stock is classified in temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheet. As it relates to the accretion to redemption value, the redeemable convertible preferred stock is not currently redeemable, nor is it
probable that the instrument will become redeemable, as it is only redeemable upon the occurrence of a contingent event. Accordingly, no accretion has been recognized for the redeemable convertible preferred stock and it will not be accreted until
it is probable that the shares will become redeemable. At December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017 and September&nbsp;30, 2018, the occurrence of the contingent events is not considered probable. </P>

Series&nbsp;F redeemable convertible preferred stock, and Series&nbsp;G redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder, at any time, into the number of shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock
determined by dividing the applicable original issue price for such series of redeemable convertible preferred stock by the applicable conversion price then in effect for such series. The applicable conversion price shall initially be $0.05, $0.075,
$0.321, $2.133, $6.167, $8.78, and 10.06&nbsp;per share, for the Series&nbsp;A redeemable convertible preferred stock, Series&nbsp;B redeemable convertible preferred stock, Series&nbsp;C redeemable convertible preferred stock, Series&nbsp;D
redeemable convertible preferred stock, Series&nbsp;E redeemable convertible preferred stock, Series&nbsp;F redeemable convertible preferred stock, and Series&nbsp;G redeemable convertible preferred stock, respectively. In the case of Series&nbsp;H
redeemable convertible preferred stock, shares are not convertible at the option of the holder until the date that is twenty-one months following the date of filing of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, February&nbsp;7,
2020, after which, shares are convertible at the option of the holder with an applicable conversion price of $10.06 per share, consistent with the mechanics of conversion for the other series of redeemable convertible preferred stock. Each
applicable conversion ratio will be adjusted, if applicable, at the time of conversion of a share of redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock. The adjustment will contemplate cash distributions made to holders of the redeemable
convertible preferred stock through the date of conversion by decreasing the number of shares of common stock into which the redeemable convertible preferred stock will convert by an amount equal to the distributions divided by the fair value of the
common stock at the time of conversion. All outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock will be automatically converted into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at the applicable conversion ratio then in effect
upon: (i)&nbsp;the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the requisite vote; (ii)&nbsp;the closing of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, as approved by the Board of Directors; or (iii)&nbsp;the date and time, or occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of a majority or two-thirds (as applicable) of the then outstanding shares of the
associated series of redeemable convertible preferred stock (applicable on a series-by-series basis). </P>

in connection with such transaction and (ii) $10.06. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluated each series of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and determined that each
individual series is considered an equity host under FASB ASC Topic No.&nbsp;815, <I>Derivatives and Hedging</I> (ASC 815). In making this determination, we followed the whole instrument approach, which compares an individual feature against the
entire preferred stock instrument which includes that feature. Our analysis was based on a consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of each series of redeemable convertible preferred stock. More specifically, we evaluated all of the
stated and implied substantive terms and features, including (i)&nbsp;whether the redeemable convertible preferred stock included redemption features, (ii)&nbsp;how and when any redemption features could be exercised, (iii)&nbsp;whether the holders
of redeemable convertible preferred stock were entitled to dividends, (iv)&nbsp;the voting rights of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, (v)&nbsp;any protective provisions of the redeemable convertible preferred stock and (vi)&nbsp;the
existence and nature of any conversion rights. As a result of our conclusion that the redeemable convertible preferred stock represents an equity host, the conversion feature of all series of redeemable convertible preferred stock is considered to
be clearly and closely related to the associated preferred stock host instrument. Accordingly, the conversion feature of all series of redeemable convertible preferred stock is not considered an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We assess for potentially beneficial conversion features under FASB ASC Topic No.&nbsp;470-20, <I>Debt with Conversion and Other Options</I>
(ASC&nbsp;470-20). At the time of each of the issuances of redeemable convertible preferred stock, our common stock into which each series of redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible had an estimated fair value less than the effective
conversion prices of the redeemable convertible preferred stock. Therefore, there were no beneficial conversion features on any of the respective commitment dates. Further, any variability in the number of shares of common stock into which each
series of redeemable convertible preferred stock will convert resulting from adjustments to the applicable conversion ratio for either: (i)&nbsp;cash distributions or (ii)&nbsp;fluctuations in common stock pricing with respect to the Series H
redeemable convertible preferred stock, would result in an increase to the effective conversion prices of the associated redeemable convertible preferred stock. Therefore, upon a change in the number of shares of common stock into which each series
of redeemable convertible preferred stock will convert, the effective conversion price will remain in excess of the estimated fair value of the common stock at the commitment date so there is no contingent beneficial conversion feature for any
series of redeemable convertible preferred stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Common Stock </I></B></P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The risk-free interest rate assumption for options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve rate at the date of grant with a
maturity approximating the expected term of the grant. The expected term assumption for options granted to employees is determined using the simplified method that represents the average of the contractual term of the option and the weighted average
vesting period of the option. We use the simplified method because we do not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. For non-employee options, the contractual term of the
option issued is used as the expected term. Assumption as to expected volatility for our common stock is based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of public companies that we believe are similar in nature to us. The historical
volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. The assumed dividend yield is based upon our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The fair values per share is
determined by our board of directors as of the date of each grant based on the independent third-party valuations, taking into consideration various objective and subjective factors. </P>

history of losses and in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, has fully reserved the net deferred tax asset. We concluded that realization of our net deferred tax assets is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. The valuation
allowance increased by approximately $86.6&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, primarily due to the increase in net operating loss carry-forwards, stock-based compensation, and research and development tax credits. The valuation
allowance increased by approximately $52.8&nbsp;million in the&nbsp;year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the deferred tax assets related to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, capitalized license and research
and development tax credits. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had gross federal and state net operating losses of approximately
$1.4&nbsp;million and $1.2&nbsp;million, respectively, related to excess tax deductions that had been excluded from the above table. The benefit of these net operating losses would have been recognized as an increase in additional paid-in capital
when it resulted in a reduction of taxes payable. In January 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, <I>Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting</I>. As part of the adoption, we recorded $0.5 million additional deferred tax assets and charged
to accumulated deficit, net of tax, related to previously unrecognized tax losses with an equal and offsetting adjustment to our valuation allowance. There was no impact of the adoption on our net deferred tax assets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act). The Act was enacted, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation,
including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction
for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign
earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with the passing of the Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;118, Income
Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act directing taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as &#147;provisional&#148; when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including
computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize changes in tax law, including the Act, in the
period in which the law is enacted. Accordingly, the effects of the Act have been recognized in the financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. Items for which we were unable to determine a reasonable estimate, and thus are
considered provisional, resulted in a $64.1&nbsp;million reduction to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. Our preliminary estimate of the effects of the Act, including the re-measurement of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, is subject to the finalization of our analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provisions of the Act and the filing of our tax returns. U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions interpreting the Act may require further adjustments and changes in estimates. The final determination of the effects of the Act will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one
year from the enactment of the Act. We will continue to refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had
approximately $380.4&nbsp;million and $325.2&nbsp;million of federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards, respectively, which begin to expire in 2030. At December&nbsp;31, 2017 we also had federal and state research and development credit
carry-forwards of approximately $31.3&nbsp;million and $19.3&nbsp;million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2028. At December&nbsp;31, 2017, we also had state investment tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $2.1&nbsp;million which begin
to expire in 2018. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to
ownership change limitations that have occurred previously, or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section&nbsp;382, as well as similar state provisions and other
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Ownership changes may limit the amount of NOLs and tax credit carry-forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by

time, either party may propose that the parties conduct additional programs for the research and development of SAVs directed to different shared neoantigens. If the parties agree to conduct any such programs, then we will be responsible for
conducting and funding preclinical discovery and research activities for such SAVs, and otherwise the programs would be conducted on substantially the same terms as mRNA-5671 program. If we or Merck propose a new SAV program and the other party does
not agree to conduct such program, then the PCV/SAV Agreement includes provisions allowing the proposing party to proceed with such development, at the proposing party&#146;s expense. If Merck is the proposing party, we will be responsible for
manufacturing and supplying material for such program at Merck&#146;s expense. In such case, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-proposing</FONT> party will have the right to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">opt-in</FONT> to such SAV program
any time before the proposing party commits to performing Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-toxicity studies. Until the expiration of a defined period of time following our completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for any SAV program mutually
agreed by the parties under the PCV/SAV Agreement and delivery of an associated data package to Merck, Merck has the right to elect to participate in future development and commercialization of such SAV by making a participation payment to us. </P>

controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. </P>
